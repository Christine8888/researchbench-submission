  "instructions": [
    "Use the provided Gaia and OGLE LPV data.",
    "Apply Gaia quality and astrometric cuts as in the paper, including RUWE and E(V-I).",
    "Use the following values for photometric quality cuts: C* < 1sigma, beta < 0.99, ipd_frac_multi_peak < 7, ipd_frac_odd_win < 7",
    "Cross-match Gaia and OGLE using a 1.0 arcsec radius and keep P_1.",
    "Calculate the Wesenheit index and select A- and B-sequence stars using polynomial fits and 3-sigma width cuts.",
    "De-extinct the Gaia Synthetic I-band magnitude (`i_jkc_mag`) using the reddening map and the extinction correction from the paper.",
    "Measure the TRGB for each sequence using the specified smoothing widths (A: 0.10 mag, B: 0.20 mag). Do not perform bootstrapping or calculate uncertainty.",
    "Report the two TRGB magnitudes (A-sequence first, then B-sequence) as a list of two floats, rounded to 3 decimal places."
