    "description": "Calculate the locations of the three primary mass peaks identified by the B-Spline model.",
    "instructions": "Using the posterior samples from the B-Spline population analysis (specifically the model using IID component spins, corresponding to the main results presented), construct the population predictive distribution (PPD) for the primary mass ($m_1$). Identify the locations (in units of solar masses, $M_\\odot$) of the three distinct local maxima in the merger rate density as a function of primary mass, within the range $5 M_\\odot < m_1 < 100 M_\\odot$. Report the median and 90% credible interval (defined by the 5th and 95th percentiles) for the location of each peak. The model assumes a minimum black hole mass of $5 M_\\odot$ and uses B-splines interpolated over knots linearly spaced in $\\log(m_1)$. Format the output as a dictionary where keys are 'peak1', 'peak2', 'peak3' (corresponding to the peaks around 10, 18, and 35 M_sun respectively) and values are lists of [median, upper_bound, lower_bound].",
