    "description": "Calculate the peak location, fraction of negatively tilted spins, and the alignment-to-anti-alignment ratio (log10Y) for the spin orientation distribution from the B-Spline IID model.",
    "instructions": "Using the posterior samples from the B-Spline population analysis assuming identical and independently distributed (IID) component spins, construct the population predictive distribution (PPD) for the cosine of the spin tilt angle, $p(\\cos{\\theta})$, where the tilt angle $\\theta$ is the angle between a component's spin vector and the binary's orbital angular momentum vector. Find the location of the peak ($\\cos{\\theta_\\mathrm{peak}}$) of this distribution. Calculate the fraction of systems with misaligned spins, $f_{\\cos{\\theta}<0} = \\int_{-1}^{0} d\\cos{\\theta} p(\\cos{\\theta})$. Calculate the quantity $Y \\equiv \\frac{\\int_{0.9}^{1.0} d\\cos{\\theta} p(\\cos{\\theta})}{\\int_{-1.0}^{-0.9} d\\cos{\\theta} p(\\cos{\\theta})}$ and report its base-10 logarithm, $\\log_{10}Y$. Report the median and 90% credible interval (defined by the 5th and 95th percentiles) for $\\cos{\\theta_\\mathrm{peak}}$, $f_{\\cos{\\theta}<0}$, and $\\log_{10}Y$. The B-spline model uses 16 knots spaced linearly from -1 to 1. Format the output as a dictionary with keys 'cos_theta_peak', 'f_neg_cos_theta', 'log10_Y', where values are lists of [median, upper_bound, lower_bound].",
