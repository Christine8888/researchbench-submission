    "instructions": "Using the posterior samples from the B-Spline population analysis assuming identical and independently distributed (IID) component spins, construct the population predictive distribution (PPD) for the spin magnitude ($a$). Find the location of the peak ($a_\\mathrm{peak}$) of this distribution. Also, calculate the spin magnitude ($a_\\mathrm{90\\%}$) below which 90% of the BBH spins lie (i.e., the 90th percentile of the PPD). Report the median and 90% credible interval (defined by the 5th and 95th percentiles) for both $a_\\mathrm{peak}$ and $a_\\mathrm{90\\%}$. The B-spline model uses 16 knots spaced linearly from 0 to 1. Format the output as a dictionary with keys 'a_peak' and 'a_90', where values are lists of [median, upper_bound, lower_bound].",
