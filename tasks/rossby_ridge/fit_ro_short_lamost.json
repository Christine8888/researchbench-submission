    "instructions": "Load the LAMOST-McQuillan cross-matched data (`lamostmcq`, derived from `kepler_lamost.parquet` and `mcquillan2014_table1.parquet`). Select stars with logg > 4.1. Approximate the short-period edge by computing the 10th percentile of rotation periods (Prot) in overlapping Teff bins. Use 100 bootstrapped resamples, leaving out 50% of the data each time. Use Teff bins centered every 20 K between 4000 K and 7000 K with half-widths of 100 K. Omit stars with calculated Ro > 5/3 (using Eq. 1 and 2) during the percentile calculation. Compute the final short-period edge curve as the mean of the bootstrapped 10th percentile values. Fit a constant Rossby number model to this edge curve in the range 4500 K <= Teff <= 5800 K using MCMC. The model is Prot(Ro, Teff) = Ro * tau_cz(Teff + Tsys), where tau_cz is given by Equation 2 in the paper: tau_cz(Teff) = 314.24 * exp(-(Teff / 1952.5 K) - (Teff / 6250 K)**18) + 0.002. Use the likelihood function defined in Equation 3, with variance s_n^2 = sigma^2 + f^2 * Prot(Ro, Teff + Tsys)^2 (Equation 4), assuming sigma corresponds to a 10% fractional uncertainty on the percentile curve Prot values. Use uniform priors for Ro (0.1, 10), f (0, 10), and Tsys (-1000 K, 1000 K). Run the MCMC sampling (e.g., 32 walkers, 10^5 steps, assess convergence). Report the median posterior value for the Rossby number (Ro).",
