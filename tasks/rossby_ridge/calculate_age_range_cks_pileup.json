    "description": "Determine the age range encompassing 90% of the CKS stars located on the long-period pileup, using CKS catalog ages.",
    "instructions": "Load the CKS data (e.g., from `cks_merged.parquet`), ensuring it includes isochrone ages derived using the CKS pipeline ('CKS ages'). Select stars identified as being on the long-period pileup using the criteria described in Section 3.2: Prot is between (-0.0314 * Teff + 199.286) and (-0.0314 * Teff + 206.286). Use 'CKS Teff' values for this selection. Additionally apply the cuts logg > 4.0 and 5850 K < Teff < 6500 K. Extract the isochrone ages (in Gyr) for these selected stars from the CKS catalog source. Calculate the 5th and 95th percentiles of these ages. Report the age range as a list [5th_percentile_age, 95th_percentile_age].",

This implies the range covering the central 90% of stars, likely corresponding to the 5th and 95th percentiles. Tolerances are estimated.",
