    "instructions": "Load the LAMOST-McQuillan cross-matched data (`lamostmcq`) and select stars with logg > 4.1. Calculate the observed 90th percentile Prot curve as a function of Teff using the bootstrapping method described in task 'fit_rocrit_long_lamost' (100 resamples, 50% withheld, 20K bins with 100K half-width, Ro > 5/3 excluded). Load the two model populations provided ('standard_population.h5' and 'rocrit_population.h5'). For each model, select only main-sequence stars (evo = 1). Calculate the 90th percentile Prot curve as a function of Teff for each model population using the same binning scheme as for the observed data. Compare the observed 90th percentile curve to the 90th percentile curves from the standard and WMB models over the Teff range 5300 K to 6000 K. Calculate the chi-squared statistic for both the standard model fit (chi2_std) and the WMB model fit (chi2_wmb) relative to the observed curve, assuming a fixed uncertainty (e.g., derived from the bootstrap variance of the observed percentile curve or a nominal value like 1 day if variance is too small). Compute the difference Delta_chi2 = chi2_std - chi2_wmb. Report the value of Delta_chi2.",

Tolerance is estimated based on potential variations in percentile calculation and chi2 definition.",
