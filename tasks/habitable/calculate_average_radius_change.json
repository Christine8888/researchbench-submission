    "description": "Calculate the average percentage radius change for planets in the runaway greenhouse regime compared to those outside it, using the paper's fiducial model parameters.",
    "instructions": "Generate a synthetic planet population according to the baseline model described in Section 2, using the provided dataset resources where applicable. Apply the runaway greenhouse model described in Section 3 to modify planet radii based on instellation. Use the fiducial parameters: injected instellation threshold `S_thresh` = \\var{injectedSthresh} (defined as `injectedSthresh,\\SI{280}{\\watt\\per\\meter\\squared}` in variables.dat), bulk water mass fraction `x_H2O` = \\var{wrr} (defined as `wrr,0.005` in variables.dat), and dilution factor `f_rgh` = \\frgh (defined as `\\newcommand{\\frgh}{0.8}`). Consider planets with masses below 2 M_earth and instellation between 10 and 2000 W/m^2. Calculate the average transit radius for planets with instellation `S > S_thresh` and the average transit radius for planets with `S <= S_thresh`. Determine the percentage change between these two average radii. Report the percentage change.",
