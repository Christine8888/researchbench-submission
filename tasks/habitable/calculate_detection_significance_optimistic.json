    "instructions": "Simulate the 'optimistic scenario' survey described in Section 5.2. This involves generating a synthetic planet sample of size N = \\var{N_optimistic} (defined as `N_optimistic,500` in variables.dat), injecting the runaway greenhouse effect using fiducial parameters (`S_thresh` = \\var{injectedSthresh} defined as `injectedSthresh,\\SI{280}{\\watt\\per\\meter\\squared}`, `x_H2O` = \\var{wrr} defined as `wrr,0.005`, `f_rgh` = \\frgh defined as `\\newcommand{\\frgh}{0.8}`), applying measurement uncertainties ($\\sigma_R = 2\\%$, $\\sigma_S = 5\\%$, as defined via macros `\\sigmaR` and `\\sigmaS`), and applying selection criteria (Section 4.1). Use the provided dataset resources (e.g., pre-computed model grids or simulated survey data for the optimistic scenario if available) to expedite the process where possible. Perform the Bayesian hypothesis testing comparing the runaway greenhouse hypothesis (H_rgh, Eq. 3) against the null hypothesis (H_0) using the simulated radius measurements. Use the moving average approach described in Section 4.3 with `windowsize`=25 (defined as `\\newcommand{\\windowsize}{25}`). Use the priors defined in Section 4.3 and the likelihood function from Section 4.3. Estimate the Bayesian evidences Z_rgh and Z_0 using nested sampling (e.g., dynesty) and calculate the difference Delta ln Z = ln Z_rgh - ln Z_0. Report the approximate value of Delta ln Z.",
