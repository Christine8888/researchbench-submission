    "description": "Determine the minimum dilution factor (f_rgh) for detecting the discontinuity with Delta ln Z > 3 using radius measurements in a PLATO-like survey with N approx 300 planets.",
    "instructions": "Simulate a PLATO-like survey yielding approximately N = \\var{N_plato} (defined as `N_plato,300` in variables.dat) characterized planets, incorporating PLATO's expected precision (e.g., $\\sigma_R = 3\\%$, $\\sigma_S = 10\\%$, $\\sigma_{M_P} = 10\\%$) and selection criteria (Section 4.1). Inject the runaway greenhouse signal using `S_thresh` = \\var{injectedSthresh} (defined as `injectedSthresh,\\SI{280}{\\watt\\per\\meter\\squared}`) and `x_H2O` = \\var{wrr} (defined as `wrr,0.005`). Vary the dilution factor `f_rgh`. For each `f_rgh`, perform the Bayesian hypothesis test comparing H_rgh and H_0 based on simulated radius measurements, calculating Delta ln Z = ln Z_rgh - ln Z_0 as described in Section 4. Use the provided dataset resources (e.g., `plato_f-grid.pkl` which likely contains results from a grid run over `f_rgh`) to determine the minimum `f_rgh` for which the median Delta ln Z from repeated simulations exceeds 3. Report this minimum `f_rgh` value.",

The variable `\\var{platoMinfrgh}` is defined as `platoMinfrgh,0.1` in variables.dat. The figure confirms that the median Delta ln Z crosses 3 near f_rgh = 0.1 for N~300 (blue line).",
