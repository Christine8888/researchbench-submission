    "instructions": "Using the final orbital parameters for the V773 Tau AB system derived in this work (listed in Table 1, 'this work' column: Period = 26.50 yr, T0 = 2010.11 yr, e = 0.104, omega_A = 266.0 deg, Omega = 290.54 deg, i = 69.25 deg, a = 117.7 mas), calculate the time of the next conjunction event where the B component passes in front of the A component in projection, corresponding to the midpoint of the eclipse observed around 2010. Report the predicted year of the midpoint of the next eclipse and the uncertainty in years, as a list of two values.",
