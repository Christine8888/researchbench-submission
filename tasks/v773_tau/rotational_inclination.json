    "description": "Calculate the rotational inclination of the Aa star.",
    "instructions": "Using the rotational period attributed to the Aa star derived from the TESS light curve analysis (specifically, the longer of the two primary periods identified), the published stellar radius for Aa, and the published rotationally broadened velocity ($v \\sin i$) for Aa, calculate the inclination of the star's rotational equator to the line of sight in degrees. Use the value for the rotational period identified as 3.09 days. Use the stellar radius for Aa of $2.22 R_\\odot$ and the $v \\sin i$ for Aa of $38$ km/s, both cited from Boden et al. (2007). Assume the star rotates as a solid body. Output the resulting inclination in degrees and the uncertainty in degrees, as a list of two values.",
