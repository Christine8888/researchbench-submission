    "description": "Determine the orbital inclination of the C component around the AB barycenter.",
    "instructions": "Using the historical AC astrometry (from DucheÌ‚ne et al. 2003, Boden et al. 2012) and the new AC astrometry from this paper (Table 3), first calculate the position of C relative to the AB barycenter for each epoch, assuming the masses $M_A = 2.91 M_\\odot$ and $M_B = 2.35 M_\\odot$. Use the system distance of 132.8 pc and enforce a prior on the total system mass (A+B+C) to be between 3.5 and 7.0 $M_\\odot$. Perform an orbital fit using 'orbitize!', similar to the AB fit (1000 walkers, 20 temperatures, 2000 burn-in, 1,000,000 steps). Apply the stability criterion described in Section 4: filter the resulting posterior samples, keeping only orbits where the periastron distance of C relative to the AB barycenter is greater than 68 au. From the filtered posterior distribution, extract the orbital inclination 'i'. Report the inclination in degrees and the uncertainty in degrees, as a list of two values.",
