    "instructions": "Analyze the provided TESS light curve data for V773 Tau (file `v773tau_eleanor.csv`). Perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis on the TESS flux data over the time range MJD 58816 to 58842. Identify the two highest power periods between 1 and 5 days that are interpreted as the primary rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars. Output these two periods in days, sorted in ascending order, as a list of two elements.",
