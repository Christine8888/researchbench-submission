    "description": "Determine the projected chord width 'w' of the eclipsing disc from the light curve model.",
    "instructions": "Using the combined photometric light curve data (`v773tau_complete_lightcurve.csv`) covering the 2010 eclipse event, fit the eclipse profile using the toy model described in Section 6. The model represents the disc as a cylindrical slab with absorption following a Gaussian profile vertically ($A(z) = A_0 \\exp(-(z/\\sigma_{disc})^2)$), tilted relative to the line of sight. Use the orbital solution for AB from 'this work' in Table 1 to calculate the projected path of Aa and Ab behind B. Use an MCMC fitting procedure (like 'emcee' with 100 walkers, 300 burn-in steps as mentioned) to fit the free parameters of the model, specifically allowing the flux ratio F(Ab)/F(Aa) to be a free parameter ('All free' case). Determine the best-fit value for the projected chord width 'w' across the disc traced by the A component. Report the chord width and the uncertainty in milliarcseconds (mas), as a list of two values.",
