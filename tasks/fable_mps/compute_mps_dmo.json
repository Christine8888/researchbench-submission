  "instructions": "Download the dark matter only (DMO) simulation density cube from https://huggingface.co/datasets/martin-alvarez/Fable_datacubes. The file is stored in GRAFIC binary format, written using the `write_npcube2grafic` function (int32 shape header, float64 secondary header (header1 = np.array([x_npix, y_npix, z_npix], dtype=np.int32); header2 = np.array(header2, dtype=np.float64)), followed by Fortran-style 2D binary slices along z). Write a Python script that: 1) Loads the 3D density field 2) Applies a 3D FFT to δ(x) and computes the power spectrum P(k) = |δ(k)|². 3) Bins P(k) into logarithmically spaced spherical shells in k-space. 4) Saves the binned power spectrum as a text file with two columns: wavenumber k [h/cMpc] and P(k) [(h/cMpc)^3]. This file will be used for subsequent tasks. Additionally, extract and return the value of P(k) at k = 10.069 h/cMpc (interpolated if necessary) for evaluation.",
