    "instructions": "Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv`. Apply the quality cuts specified in Table 3: 1.0 < log g < 3.8, 3500 < Teff < 5500 K, S/N > 80, ASPCAPFLAG bit 23 not set, EXTRATARG bits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 not set, Age uncertainty (`Age_sigma_L23`) < 40%, 3 < Rgal < 15 kpc, |z| < 2 kpc. Note that Rgal and z need to be calculated from the Gaia EDR3 data provided in the sample file using the specified R_sun = 8.122 kpc and z_sun = 20.8 pc. For the resulting sample of stars, use the provided [O/Fe] uncertainty column (`O_FE_ERR`). Calculate the median value of `O_FE_ERR`. Also calculate the uncertainty dispersion as the difference between the 95th percentile and the 5th percentile of the `O_FE_ERR` values. Return the median and dispersion as a list or tuple: `[median_uncertainty, uncertainty_dispersion]`.",
