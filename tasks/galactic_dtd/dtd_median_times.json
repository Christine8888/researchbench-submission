    "instructions": "Implement the functional forms for the SN Ia DTDs as defined in Section 2.2. Specifically, use Equation 8 for the Exponential DTD with parameter tau = 1.5 Gyr, and Equation 9 for the Plateau DTD with parameters W = 1 Gyr and alpha = -1.1. For both DTDs, use the fiducial minimum delay time tD = 40 Myr (0.04 Gyr) and maximum time tmax = 13.2 Gyr as specified in Table 1. For each DTD form fIa(t), calculate the normalized cumulative distribution function (CDF) between tD and tmax: CDF(t) = Integral[fIa(t') dt' from tD to t] / Integral[fIa(t') dt' from tD to tmax]. Find the time 't_med' for each DTD where CDF(t_med) = 0.5. Return the median times in Gyr for the Exponential (tau=1.5 Gyr) and Plateau (W=1 Gyr) DTDs as a list, in that order: `[t_med_exp_1.5, t_med_plat_1.0]`.",
