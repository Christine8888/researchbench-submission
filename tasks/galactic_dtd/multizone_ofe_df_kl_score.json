    "description": "Calculate the weighted average Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence score comparing the model [O/Fe] distribution to the APOGEE [O/Fe] distribution for the Inside-Out SFH combined with the Triple-system DTD.",
    "instructions": "Load the multi-zone simulation output for the model combining the Inside-Out Star Formation History (SFH) and the Triple-system Delay-Time Distribution (DTD) from the `multizone.tar.gz` archive. Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv`, calculate Rgal and z for each star (using R_sun = 8.122 kpc, z_sun = 20.8 pc), and apply the quality cuts specified in Table 3. For each model stellar population in the simulation output, apply a random Gaussian scatter to its [O/Fe] value, drawing the standard deviation of the scatter from a Gaussian distribution centered on the median observational uncertainty reported in Table 5 (0.019 dex) with a small width to account for variation, or simply use the median value 0.019 dex for all scatters. Divide both the model stars (using their mass weighting) and the APOGEE stars into the 18 Galactic regions defined by Rgal bins (3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15 kpc) and |z| bins (0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0 kpc). Within each region, estimate the probability density functions (PDFs) for both the model ([O/Fe]) and APOGEE ([O/Fe]) distributions (e.g., using histograms or kernel density estimation). Calculate the KL divergence DKL(P||Q) = Integral[p(x) * log(p(x)/q(x)) dx] using Equation 18, where P is the APOGEE PDF (p(x)) and Q is the model PDF (q(x)), and x = [O/Fe]. Use an integration step size d[O/Fe] = 0.01 dex or numerical integration over the estimated PDFs. Compute the final score S as the average of the DKL values across all 18 regions, weighted by the number of APOGEE stars in each region (N_star(Rgal, |z|)) as defined in Equation 19, using the counts derivable from `sample.csv` or approximated by Table 4.",
