    "instructions": "Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv`. Calculate Rgal and z for each star using the provided Gaia EDR3 data, assuming R_sun = 8.122 kpc and z_sun = 20.8 pc. Apply the quality cuts specified in Table 3: 1.0 < log g < 3.8, 3500 < Teff < 5500 K, S/N > 80, ASPCAPFLAG bit 23 not set, EXTRATARG bits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 not set, Age uncertainty (`Age_sigma_L23`) < 40%, 3 < Rgal < 15 kpc, |z| < 2 kpc. Count the number of stars falling into the following two specific spatial bins after all cuts are applied: (1) 7 < Rgal <= 9 kpc and 0.5 < |z| <= 1.0 kpc; (2) 9 < Rgal <= 11 kpc and 0.0 <= |z| <= 0.5 kpc. Return these two counts as a list: `[count_bin1, count_bin2]`.",

The value listed for Rgal=(7, 9] kpc, |z|=(0.5, 1.0] kpc is 13811. The value listed for Rgal=(9, 11] kpc, |z|=(0.0, 0.5] kpc is 16276.
