    "description": "Calculate the weighted average RMS median age difference score comparing the model Age-[O/Fe] relation to the APOGEE/L23 data for the Two-infall SFH combined with the Triple-system DTD.",
    "instructions": "Load the multi-zone VICE simulation output for the model combining the Two-infall Star Formation History (SFH) and the Triple-system Delay-Time Distribution (DTD) from `multizone.tar.gz`. Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv`, calculate Rgal and z, apply the quality cuts specified in Table 3, and merge with the L23 ages. Retain only stars with L23 age uncertainty (`Age_sigma_L23`) < 40%. For each model stellar population, apply random Gaussian scatter to its [O/Fe] (using median uncertainty 0.019 dex from Table 5) and log(Age/Gyr) (using median uncertainty 0.10 dex from Table 5). Convert log(Age/Gyr) to Age in Gyr for both model and data. Divide both the model stars and the APOGEE/L23 stars into the 18 Galactic regions defined by Rgal bins (3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15 kpc) and |z| bins (0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0 kpc). Within each region, bin the stars by [O/Fe] using a bin width of 0.05 dex. For each [O/Fe] bin k containing stars in both model and data, calculate the difference between the mass-weighted median age of the model stars (med(tau_VICE)) and the median age of the APOGEE/L23 stars (med(tau_L23)), denoted as Delta_tau_k = med(tau_VICE) - med(tau_L23). Calculate the RMS median age difference for the region, Delta_tau_RMS, using Equation 21: Delta_tau_RMS = sqrt( Sum[ (Delta_tau_k^2 * n_L23,k) / n_L23,tot ] ), where n_L23,k is the number of APOGEE/L23 stars in bin k and n_L23,tot is the total number of APOGEE/L23 stars in the region. Exclude bins with no model or observed stars from the sum. Compute the final score S as the average of the Delta_tau_RMS values across all 18 regions, weighted by the total number of APOGEE/L23 stars (n_L23,tot) in each region.",
