    "instructions": "Using the MESA outputs with the same parameters as the paper (Z = 0.0019, initial period P = 100 days, and initial masses (M1, M2) = (18, 15), (20, 17), (38, 30) M☉), calculate the overall mass transfer efficiency (βRLOF = |ΔMaccretor/ΔMdonor|) for each of the three binary systems. Return the three efficiency values.",
