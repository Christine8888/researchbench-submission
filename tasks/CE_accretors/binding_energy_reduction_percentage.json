    "instructions": "Using MESA (version 15140) with the same parameters as the paper (Z = 0.0019, initial period P = 100 days, and initial masses (M1, M2) = (18, 15), (20, 17), (38, 30) M☉), calculate the binding energy of the envelopes (BE(m = MHe, αth = 1)) for both accretor and single star models of the same total post-RLOF mass. Calculate the percentage reduction in binding energy for each of the three mass configurations at R = 500 R☉. Return the minimum and maximum percentage reduction values.",
