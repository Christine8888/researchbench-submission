    "instructions": "Using the MESA outputs with the same parameters as the paper (Z = 0.0019, initial period P = 100 days, and initial masses (M1, M2) = (18, 15), (20, 17), (38, 30) M☉), evolve the accretor models and calculate the duration of the blue loop phases in years for the two lowest mass accretors. The blue loop is defined as the excursion to hotter temperatures after beginning to ascend the Hayashi track. Return the durations in years for the two lowest mass accretors.",
