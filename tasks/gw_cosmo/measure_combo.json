    "instructions": "Simulate gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations within a flat LambdaCDM cosmological model with fiducial parameters H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and Omega_M = 0.3. Assume the BNS merger rate follows the Madau-Dickinson Star Formation Rate (SFR) as described by Eq. 6 in the paper:\nR(z) propto (1 + z)^2.7 / (1 + ((1+z)/2.9)^5.6).\nDerive the corresponding redshift distribution p(z) using Eq. 5 and Eq. 7, normalizing over 0 < z < 8.\nFor each simulated event, draw a redshift z_i from p(z), calculate the true luminosity distance D_L(z_i) using Eq. 1, 2, 3 (with w=-1, wa=0). Simulate an observed distance D_L^obs,i by drawing from a lognormal distribution with mean log(D_L(z_i)) and standard deviation sigma = 0.1 (as described in Eq. 10 and surrounding text).\nApply a selection effect by only keeping events where D_L^obs,i < D_L^max = 40 Gpc.\nPerform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis (Section II.A) on a large number N (e.g., N=10,000) of *detected* events to infer the joint posterior distribution for H0 and Omega_M, assuming flat priors. Account for selection effects using Eq. 12 and Eq. 14.\nAnalyze the degeneracy observed in the 2D posterior distribution of H0 and Omega_M. Fit this degeneracy with a power-law relationship of the form H0^m * Omega_M^n = constant. Following the paper's approach (Section III.A), fix the exponent n=1 for Omega_M.\nDetermine the best-fit value for the exponent m corresponding to H0.\nReport the value of m as a single float.",
