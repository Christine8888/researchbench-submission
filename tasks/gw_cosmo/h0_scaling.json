    "instructions": "Simulate gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations within a flat LambdaCDM cosmological model with fiducial parameters H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and Omega_M = 0.3. Assume the BNS merger rate follows the Madau-Dickinson Star Formation Rate (SFR) as described by Eq. 6 in the paper:\nR(z) propto (1 + z)^2.7 / (1 + ((1+z)/2.9)^5.6).\nDerive the corresponding redshift distribution p(z) using Eq. 5 and Eq. 7, normalizing over 0 < z < 8.\nFor each simulated event, draw a redshift z_i from p(z), calculate the true luminosity distance D_L(z_i) using Eq. 1, 2, 3 (with w=-1, wa=0). Simulate an observed distance D_L^obs,i by drawing from a lognormal distribution with mean log(D_L(z_i)) and standard deviation sigma = 0.1 (as described in Eq. 10 and surrounding text).\nApply a selection effect by only keeping events where D_L^obs,i < D_L^max = 40 Gpc.\nPerform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis (Section II.A) on a large number N (e.g., N=10,000) of *detected* events to infer the posterior distribution for H0 and Omega_M, accounting for selection effects using Eq. 12 and Eq. 14.\nFrom the posterior, determine the 1-sigma uncertainty (width of the 68% credible interval) for the combination log(H0^2.8 * Omega_M). Note the exponent m=2.8 is derived from the task 'measure_combo'.\nThe fractional uncertainty width scales as alpha / sqrt(N). Calculate the value of alpha, which represents the fractional 1-sigma uncertainty width for N=1, based on the width measured for large N. The fractional width is defined as the interval width divided by the true value of log(H0^2.8 * Omega_M).\nReport the value of alpha as a single float.",
