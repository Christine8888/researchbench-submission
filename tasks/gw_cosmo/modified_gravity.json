    "description": "Predict the 1-sigma constraint (one-sided uncertainty) on the modified gravity parameter cM (running of the Planck mass) using 10,000 simulated GW events, assuming a fixed flat LambdaCDM background cosmology.",
    "instructions": "Simulate N=10,000 gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations assuming a flat LambdaCDM background cosmology (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, Omega_Lambda = 0.7) but incorporating modified GW propagation parameterized by cM. Use a true value of cM = 0 (General Relativity).\nAssume the BNS merger rate follows the Madau-Dickinson Star Formation Rate (SFR) as described by Eq. 6 in the paper:\nR(z) propto (1 + z)^2.7 / (1 + ((1+z)/2.9)^5.6).\nDerive the corresponding redshift distribution p(z) using Eq. 5 and Eq. 7, normalizing over 0 < z < 8.\nFor each simulated event, draw a redshift z_i from p(z), calculate the electromagnetic luminosity distance D_L^EM(z_i) using Eq. 1, 2, 3 (with w=-1, wa=0). Calculate the gravitational-wave luminosity distance D_L^GW(z_i) using Eq. 4, incorporating the true value cM = 0.\nSimulate an observed distance D_L^obs,i by drawing from a lognormal distribution with mean log(D_L^GW(z_i)) and standard deviation sigma = 0.1 (as described in Eq. 10 and surrounding text).\nApply a selection effect by only keeping events where D_L^obs,i < D_L^max = 40 Gpc.\nPerform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis (Section II.A) on the N=10,000 *detected* events to infer the posterior distribution for cM. During the inference, use the modified D_L^GW from Eq. 4 (which now depends on the parameter cM being inferred) in the likelihood calculation. Treat the background cosmological parameters H0 and Omega_M as fixed constants at their true values (H0 = 70, Omega_M = 0.3), as specified in Section III.C. Account for selection effects using Eq. 12 and Eq. 14, where D_L in Eq. 14 should be D_L^GW.\nDetermine the symmetric 68.3% credible interval for cM around the median (or true value, cM = 0).\nCalculate the one-sided constraint, defined as the standard deviation or the half-width of the 68.3% CI.\nReport the one-sided constraint as a single positive float.",

This assumes N=10,000 events and likely D_L^max = 40 Gpc, with fixed background cosmology as confirmed in Section III.C."
