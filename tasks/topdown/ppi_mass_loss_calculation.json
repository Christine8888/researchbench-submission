    "instructions": "1. The paper presents a fitting formula for the amount of mass lost due to pulsational-pair instability (PPI) as a function of carbon-oxygen core mass (MCO) and metallicity (Z). You must first fit this formula. \n2. Download the datafile1.txt from Zenodo (record ID 3346593). \n3. Implement this formula in Python.\n4. Calculate ΔM_PPI for MCO = 50 M☉ and Z = 0.001 (solar masses).\n5. Return the calculated mass loss in solar masses.",
