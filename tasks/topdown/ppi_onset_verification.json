  "description": "Verify that the fitted formula correctly predicts zero mass loss at the edge of the PPI regime.",
  "instructions": "1. The paper states that one advantage of their top-down approach is that it imposes ΔMPPI = 0 at the edge of the PPI regime, producing a smooth BH mass distribution.\n2. The PPI regime begins at MCO ≈ 35 M☉, as stated in the paper.\n3. Using the fitted formula computed previously, calculate ΔMPPI for MCO = 35 M☉ at Z = 0.001.\n4. Return the calculated mass loss in solar masses, which should be very close to zero but not exactly zero.",

  "output_justification": "The paper explicitly states that their approach imposes ΔMPPI = 0 at the edge of the PPI regime (MCO ≈ 35 M☉), and their formula is designed to ensure this. The value of ΔMPPI for MCO = 35 M☉ should therefore be effectively zero."
