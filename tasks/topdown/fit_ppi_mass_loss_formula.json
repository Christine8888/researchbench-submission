  "instructions": "1. Download the datafile1.txt from Zenodo (record ID 3346593).\n2. This file contains data on carbon-oxygen core masses (MCO), metallicities (Z), and pulsational-pair instability mass loss (dMpulse).\n3. Parse the file to extract these values. The file has a header with column names.\n4. Use only data points where 38 ≤ MCO ≤ 60, as specified in the paper.\n5. Define a fitting function: f(MCO, Z) = (a × log10(Z) + b) × (MCO + c)³ + d × (MCO + c)²\n6. Use scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit this function to the data, obtaining parameters a, b, c, and d.\n7. Report the fitted value of the parameters a, b, c, and d as a list.",
