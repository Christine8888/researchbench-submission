    "description": "Calculate the maximum percentage increase in the cold gas surface density in the outskirts (R > 8 kpc) of galaxy g2.79e12 due to its major early merger phase.",
    "instructions": "Analyze the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12. Identify the cold gas particles (T < 15000 K) belonging to the main galaxy. Calculate the azimuthally averaged cold gas surface density profile at two time points: one just before the major merger activity begins (simulation time approximately t=2 Gyr) and one shortly after the merger gas has been significantly incorporated but before significant consumption (approximately t=4 Gyr). Determine the average cold gas surface density in the radial region R > 8 kpc at both times. Compute the percentage increase relative to the pre-merger density: 100 * (Density_after - Density_before) / Density_before. Report the maximum value obtained in the outskirts.",
