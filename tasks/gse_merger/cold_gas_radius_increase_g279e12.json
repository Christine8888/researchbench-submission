    "description": "Calculate the maximum factor by which the cold gas half-mass radius of galaxy g2.79e12 increases during its major early merger phase.",
    "instructions": "Analyze the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12. Identify the cold gas particles (T < 15000 K) belonging to the main galaxy progenitor. Calculate the half-mass radius of this cold gas distribution at two time points: one just before the major merger activity begins (simulation time approximately t=2 Gyr) and one near the time of maximum disk extent during the merger phase where the half-mass radius peaks (approximately t=3-4 Gyr). Calculate the ratio of the peak half-mass radius during the merger to the radius just before the merger activity.",
