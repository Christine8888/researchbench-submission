    "description": "Calculate the median [Fe/H] offset between stars associated with the late merger (merging ~9.3 Gyr) in galaxy g2.79e12 and the main galaxy stars of similar age.",
    "instructions": "Analyze the z=0 simulation snapshot for galaxy g2.79e12. Identify two distinct populations of stars based on their origin: (1) Stars formed in the main progenitor galaxy before the late merger that occurred around cosmic time t=9.3 Gyr. (2) Stars that originated in the satellite galaxy which merged at t=9.3 Gyr. (This identification requires tracing particle origins, potentially using merger tree information or unique tags within the simulation data if available, or alternatively, careful chemical and/or kinematic selection based on the distinct tracks described in the paper). Select stars from both populations within a specific stellar age range corresponding to formation shortly *before* the merger significantly impacted the main galaxy (e.g., stars with formation times between approximately 8.8 Gyr and 9.8 Gyr, corresponding to ages around 9.5-10.5 Gyr at z=0 depending on exact merger timing and age definition). Calculate the median [Fe/H] for stars in this selected age range for both the main galaxy population (median([Fe/H]_main)) and the late merger population (median([Fe/H]_merger)). Compute the difference: median([Fe/H]_main) - median([Fe/H]_merger).",

This task calculates this offset.",
