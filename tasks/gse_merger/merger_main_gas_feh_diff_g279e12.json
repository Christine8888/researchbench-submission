    "description": "Calculate the difference in peak [Fe/H] between a merging satellite's gas and the main galaxy's gas disk for one of the g2.79e12 mergers occurring at t=2.57 Gyr.",
    "instructions": "Analyze the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12 around the time of the merger events at t=2.57 Gyr. Identify the main galaxy progenitor and one of the satellites merging at this time, just before coalescence. Select the cold gas particles (T < 15000 K) associated with the main galaxy's disk (e.g., within a few scale lengths, rotationally supported) and the gas particles belonging to the identified satellite (e.g., using halo finder association). Calculate the [Fe/H] metallicity distribution function (MDF) for both gas populations. Determine the [Fe/H] value corresponding to the main peak of each MDF (for the main galaxy, use the higher-metallicity peak corresponding to the disk gas, typically [Fe/H] > -1). Calculate the difference: Peak [Fe/H] (Main Galaxy Disk Gas) - Peak [Fe/H] (Satellite Gas). Report this difference.",
