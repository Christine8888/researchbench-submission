    "description": "Calculate the percentage of simulated catalogs (from a set of 50) for which the Power Law + Peak mass model produces an H0 estimate biased by more than 1\u03c3 from the true value.",
    "instructions": "Utilize the set of 50 separate simulated GW event catalogs provided in the `bias.zip` file. For each of these 50 catalogs, perform an independent spectral siren analysis to infer H0. In each analysis, employ the 'Power Law + Peak' model for the BBH primary mass distribution (as described in the paper, referencing Abbott et al. 2021b, without a high-mass truncation). The true underlying H0 for all simulations is 67.66 km/s/Mpc, and other cosmological parameters are fixed as per a flat \u039bCDM model (\u2126M=0.3, \u2126\u039b=0.7). For each catalog's H0 posterior, calculate its mean (\u03bc_H0_inferred) and standard deviation (\u03c3_H0_inferred). A catalog's H0 estimate is considered biased by more than 1\u03c3 if the condition |\u03bc_H0_inferred - 67.66| / \u03c3_H0_inferred > 1 is met. Determine the total number of catalogs (N_biased) out of 50 that satisfy this condition. Report the result as a percentage: (N_biased / 50) * 100.",

    "output_justification": "We find that the Broken Power Law model produces an over- or   under-estimate of H0 at greater than 1Ïƒ 90%of the time, and the Power Law + Peakmodel reaches the same level of bias only 26% of the time, meaning that the Broken PowerLaw model produces a bias more than three times as often as the Power Law + Peakmodel.'",
