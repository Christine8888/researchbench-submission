    "description": "Implement a simplified version of the Bayesian inference for stellar obliquity distribution",
    "instructions": "Create a simplified implementation of the hierarchical Bayesian model from Section 3 of the paper. Generate 200 samples from a mixture of Beta distributions with the following parameters: w₀ = 0.3, w₁ = 0.7, μ₀ = 0.4, μ₁ = 0.98, κ₀ = 4.0, κ₁ = 15.0 (following equation 9). Convert these parameters to standard Beta parameters using α = μκ and β = (1-μ)κ as specified in the paper. The mixture distribution should be: cos ψ = 2(w₀u₀ + w₁u₁) - 1, where u₀ ~ Beta(α₀, β₀) and u₁ ~ Beta(α₁, β₁). Use random seed 42 for reproducibility. Then use maximum likelihood estimation to recover these parameters from the generated samples. Use scipy.optimize or similar tools for the MLE fitting. Report the inferred value of w₁ (the fraction of aligned systems) rounded to 2 decimal places. The computation should take less than 1 minute on a standard laptop.",
