    "description": "Calculate the sky-projected stellar obliquity distribution for isotropic stellar obliquity",
    "instructions": "Implement the calculation of the sky-projected stellar obliquity (λ) distribution when the stellar obliquity (ψ) is isotropically distributed (cos ψ ~ U(-1,1)). Use equation 20 from the paper and assume orbital inclination iorb = 90°. For isotropic stellar obliquity, the equation gives p(cos λ) = 1/π/√(1-cos²λ), which simplifies to p(λ) = 1/π when transforming to angle space. Calculate the probability density of observing λ = 45° (π/4 rad). Return this probability density value rounded to 4 decimal places. The computation should take less than 1 second on a standard laptop.",

    "output_justification": "For a uniformly distributed cos ψ, the paper states that λ is uniformly distributed between 0 and π. Thus p(λ) = 1/π. Since we want the probability density at λ = π/4, the answer is 1/π ≈ 0.3183."
