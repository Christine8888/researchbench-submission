    "description": "Estimate the maximum orbital separation of the transiting material based on the minimum transverse velocity derived from optical light curve gradients.",
    "instructions": "Use the ASAS-SN g' band photometry (light_curve_410e0d3c-687e-40a3-b7cb-af0057695e0b.csv, asassn_rvc.csv). Normalize the flux relative to the out-of-eclipse baseline (e.g., mean flux before MJD 58700). Identify segments of the light curve during the eclipse (approx. MJD 59350-59850) that show approximately linear changes in flux. Fit straight lines to these segments to determine the flux gradients (df/dt). Use the method described in the paper (citing Kennedy17, equations 4.2, 4.3) to convert the steepest gradients into lower limits on the transverse velocity (v_trans) across the stellar disk, assuming a stellar radius of 1.04 R_sun (from Extended Data Table 1). Identify the overall minimum robust transverse velocity derived from these gradients. Assume this minimum transverse velocity corresponds to the Keplerian orbital velocity (v_k) at the maximum possible separation (a_max). Assume a stellar mass of 1.0 M_sun. Calculate a_max using v_k = sqrt(G * M_star / a_max). Report a_max in astronomical units (au).",

    "output_justification": "The Methods section ('Duration of the eclipse and gradient analysis') states: 'we can determine a robust lower limit to the transverse velocity of 7.5 km s^-1 ... If the dust is on a circular orbit, it therefore has to be within 16 au'. The calculation v_min = 7.5 km/s -> a_max = GM*/v_min^2 yields approx 15.7 au, consistent with the paper's stated value of 16 au.",
