    "description": "Estimate the fraction of scattered light contributing during the optical dimming using AAVSO BVI photometry.",
    "instructions": "Use the AAVSO B, V, and I band photometry data (aavsodata_63e2220f49f39.txt, aavso_rvc.txt). Calculate the B-V and V-I colors. Plot the V magnitude against the B-V color during the dimming event (approx. MJD 59350-59850). Model the observed color-magnitude relationship. Assume the dimming is caused by extinction following a standard interstellar law (e.g., Cardelli et al. 1989, with R_V ~ 3.1), but also include a constant, unextincted scattered light component that has the same intrinsic color as the star. Fit this extinction + scattering model to the V vs (B-V) data during the deep dimming phase where the 'blueing' effect is apparent. Determine the best-fit fraction of the total unextincted flux that is contributed by this scattered light component. Report this fraction as a percentage.",

    "output_justification": "The Methods section ('Dust properties from optical colors') describes modeling the blueing effect in the B-V color-magnitude diagram: 'The solid lines show an extinction model where an underlying scattered light component with the same colour as the star has been added... The fraction of scattered light is relatively large at 7.5%'.",
