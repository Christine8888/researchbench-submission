    "instructions": "Use the provided NEOWISE photometry data (ASASSN-21qj_2013-2022.tbl, neowise_rvc.csv). Determine the median pre-brightening W1 and W2 fluxes (e.g., before MJD 58700). Identify the epoch corresponding to the peak infrared excess after brightening starts. Subtract the median pre-brightening fluxes from the peak post-brightening fluxes in both W1 and W2 bands to isolate the excess flux. Account for contamination from the nearby star by using Gaia photometry for the star and the post/pre-brightening flux difference for the excess, as described in the Methods section. Fit a blackbody model to the excess W1 and W2 fluxes at the peak epoch to determine the temperature (in Kelvin) and the fractional luminosity (L_dust / L_star). Report the best-fit temperature and fractional luminosity as a tuple (temperature, fractional_luminosity).",
