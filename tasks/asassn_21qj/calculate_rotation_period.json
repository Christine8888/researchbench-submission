    "instructions": "Retrieve the TESS Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP) light curve data for ASASSN-21qj from Sector 8 (hlsp_qlp_tess_ffi_s0008-0000000182582608_tess_v01_llc.fits). Perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis on the TESS flux data from Sector 8. Identify the period corresponding to the most significant peak in the periodogram, excluding trivial aliases like 1 day. Report the period in days.",
