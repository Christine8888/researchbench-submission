    "instructions": "Based on your previous results using the HST_observations_satellite_trail_classifications.csv dataset, complete the following task: Calculate the chance of seeing a satellite trail in the HST images by normalizing with the exposure time of the HST observations and scaling to the width of the FoV of ACS/WFC (202'') as in Equation 4 in the Appendix of the paper for the time period 2009-2020 (pre2020) and the WFC3/UVIS instrument. Return the result as a float from 0 to 1.",
