    "instructions": "Given the ‘eventfiles_table.csv’ file from https://huggingface.co/datasets/StevenDillmann/chandra_xray_eventfiles, reproduce the 2D-PCA embedding space from the paper: 1) Build the E-t maps (2D eventfile representations) as detailed in the paper (do not normalize the histogram values here). Note, only consider energies in the range 0.5-7 keV. 2) Apply PCA with 15 components (feature extraction). 3) Apply tsne with the given hyperparameters in the paper (dimensionality reduction), early exaggeration should be set to 1 and the initialization to random with random state 11. 4) Save the embedding results to a file called paper2DPCA_embedding.csv with the columns tsne1, tsne2, obsreg_id. Return the complete path to the file.",
