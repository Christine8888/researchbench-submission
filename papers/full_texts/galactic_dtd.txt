ABSTRACT
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore
are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately
after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by
supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age,
[Fe/H], and [α/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky
Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms
of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone
chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar
medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final
data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that
the DTD has the largest effect on the [α/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a
stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [α/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot
explain the observed bimodality in the [α/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star
formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-α sequence.
Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial t
−1 power law.
1. INTRODUCTION
Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) studies seek to explain the observed distribution of metals throughout
the Milky Way Galaxy. Tinsley (1979) made a compelling case that the non-solar [α/Fe]1
ratios seen by,
e.g., Wallerstein (1962) were caused by different stellar
lifetimes for the contributors of the Fe-peak elements
than the α-elements. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the
thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs
(WDs), are responsible for a majority of the Fe produced
in the Galaxy (Matteucci & Greggio 1986); meanwhile,
core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the explosions of
massive stars, produce the α-elements (e.g., O and Mg)

In standard bracket notation, [X/Y ] ≡ log10(X/Y ) −
log10(X/Y )⊙. In this paper we will use [α/Fe] and [O/Fe] interchangeably, although observational studies will often use a
combination of α-elements to calculate [α/Fe].
in addition to a smaller fraction of Fe. SNe Ia are delayed by ∼ 0.04 − 10 Gyr after star formation events, as
evidenced by observations in both star-forming and elliptical galaxies (e.g., Maza & van den Bergh 1976). This
delayed enrichment leads to a decrease in [α/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] (Matteucci & Greggio 1986). Therefore,
the relative abundances of the α-elements and Fe as a
function of stellar age trace the balance of SN rates over
time.
The delay-time distribution (DTD) refers to the rate
of SN Ia events per unit mass of star formation as a function of stellar population age (for a review, see Section
3.5 of Maoz et al. 2014). When the DTD is convolved
with the Galactic star formation rate (SFR), it yields
the overall SN Ia rate. The quantitative details of the
relationship between [α/Fe] and [Fe/H] are set by the
DTD, and as such it is a key parameter in GCE models.
However, the DTD remains poorly constrained because
it reflects the detailed evolution of the SN Ia progenitor

systems, so different models for the progenitors of SNe
Ia will naturally predict different forms for the DTD.
The explosion mechanism(s) of SNe Ia are not fully
understood (for reviews, see Maoz et al. 2014; Livio &
Mazzali 2018; Ruiter 2020; Liu et al. 2023). Two general
production channels have been proposed. In the singledegenerate (SD) case, the WD accretes mass from a
close non-degenerate companion until it surpasses ∼ 1.4
M⊙ and explodes (Whelan & Iben 1973; Nomoto 1982;
Yoon & Langer 2003). In the double-degenerate (DD)
case, two WDs merge after a gravitational-wave inspiral (Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984; Pakmor et al.
2012) or head-on collision (Benz et al. 1989; Thompson
2011). Searches for signs of interaction between the SN
ejecta and a non-degenerate companion (e.g., Panagia
et al. 2006; Chomiuk et al. 2016; Fausnaugh et al. 2019;
Tucker et al. 2020; Dubay et al. 2022) or for a surviving
companion (e.g., Schaefer & Pagnotta 2012; Do et al.
2021; Tucker & Shappee 2023) have placed tight constraints on the SD channel, heavily disfavoring it as the
main pathway for producing “normal” SNe Ia. The DD
channel is now the preferred model, but it faces issues
with matching observed SN Ia rates because not all WD
mergers necessarily lead to a thermonuclear explosion
(e.g., Nomoto & Iben 1985; Saio & Nomoto 1998; Shen
et al. 2012), and the progenitor systems are difficult to
detect even within our own Galaxy (Rebassa-Mansergas
et al. 2019).
As a result of the uncertainty regarding SN Ia progenitors, theoretical models have yet to converge on a single
prediction for the DTD. For the DD channel, assumptions about the distribution of WD separations and the
rate of gravitational wave inspiral suggest a broad ∼ t
−1
DTD at long delay times (≳ 1 Gyr), but at short delays
(≲ 1 Gyr) the rate is limited by the need to produce
two WDs (see Greggio 2005; Maoz et al. 2014). Triple
or higher-order progenitor systems could also produce
a t
−1 DTD (Fang et al. 2018; Rajamuthukumar et al.
2023). The DTD which would result from the SD channel depends greatly on the assumptions of binary population synthesis, but in general is expected to cover a
narrower range of delay times and may feature a steep
exponential cutoff at the long end (e.g., Greggio 2005).
Surveys of SNe Ia can constrain the DTD by comparing the observed rate of SNe Ia to their host galaxy
parameters (e.g., Mannucci et al. 2005; Heringer et al.
2019) or inferred star formation histories (SFHs; e.g.,
Maoz et al. 2012), measuring SN Ia rates in galaxy clusters (e.g., Maoz et al. 2010), or comparing the volumetric
SN Ia rate to the cosmic SFH as a whole (e.g., Graur
et al. 2014; Strolger et al. 2020). Early studies, which
had limited sample sizes, produced unimodal (Strolger
et al. 2004) or bimodal (Mannucci et al. 2006) DTDs
where the majority of SNe Ia explode within a relatively
narrow range of delay times. More recent studies have
recovered broader DTD functions, with many converging on a declining power-law of ∼ t
−1
(e.g., Graur &
Maoz 2013; Graur et al. 2015; Maoz & Graur 2017; Castrillo et al. 2021; Wiseman et al. 2021), though there
is some evidence for a steeper slope in galaxy clusters
(Maoz & Graur 2017; Friedmann & Maoz 2018). It is
especially difficult to constrain the DTD for short delay times (Maoz & Mannucci 2012; Rodney et al. 2014)
because of the need for SN Ia rates at long lookback
times and uncertainties in the age estimates of stellar
populations.
The uncertainties in the SN Ia DTD propagate into
GCE models. In principle, the observed chemical abundance patterns should therefore contain information
about the DTD, and by extension the progenitors of
SNe Ia. The metallicity distribution function (MDF)2
and distribution of [O/Fe] record the history of SN Ia
enrichment as a function of stellar age and location in
the Galaxy. A striking feature of the [α/Fe] distribution
in the Milky Way disk is the distinct separation into two
components, the high- and low-α sequences, at similar
metallicity (e.g., Bensby et al. 2014). Since the [α/Fe]
abundance reflects the ratio of CCSN to SN Ia enrichment, the DTD should influence the [α/Fe] bimodality.
A few studies have investigated different DTDs in
one-zone chemical evolution models, but comparisons
to abundance data have been limited to the solar neighborhood (e.g., Andrews et al. 2017; Palicio et al. 2023).
Matteucci et al. (2009) compared five DTDs in a multizone GCE model and found that the agreement with
observations worsens if the fraction of prompt (t ≲ 100
Myr) SNe Ia is either too high or too low, but they
were similarly limited by the available data for the solar neighborhood. Poulhazan et al. (2018) found that
the prompt component of the DTD affects the peak
and width of the [α/Fe] distribution in a cosmological smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulation, but
their simulation was not designed to reproduce the parameters of the Milky Way. The current era of large
spectroscopic surveys such as the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; Majewski et al. 2017) and the ongoing Milky Way Mapper
(Kollmeier et al. 2017) has made abundances across the
Milky Way disk available for comparison to more sophisticated GCE models.

In this paper, we refer to the MDF and the distribution of [Fe/H]
interchangeably.
SN Ia DTD in GCE Models 3
This paper presents a comprehensive look at the DTD
in a multi-zone GCE model that can qualitatively reproduce the observed abundance structure of the Milky
Way disk. A multi-zone approach allows for a radiallydependent parameterization of the SFH, outflows, stellar migration, and abundance gradient which can better
match observations across the Galactic disk. We evaluate a selection of DTDs from the literature with multiple
SFHs and a prescription for radial stellar migration in
the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE;
Johnson & Weinberg 2020). In Section 2, we present
our models for the DTD and SFH and describe our observational sample. In Section 3, we detail our one-zone
chemical evolution models and present results. In Section 4, we present the results of our multi-zone models
and compare to observations. In Section 5, we discuss
the implications for the DTD and future surveys. In
Section 6, we summarize our conclusions.
2. METHODS
We use VICE to run chemical evolution models which
closely follow those of Johnson & Weinberg (2020) and
Johnson et al. (2021, hereafter J21). We refer the interested reader to the former for details about the VICE
package and to the latter for details about the model
Milky Way disk, including the star formation law, radial
density gradient, and outflows. Similar to J21, we adopt
a prescription for radial migration based on the h277 hydrodynamical simulation (Christensen et al. 2012). In
Appendix C, we describe our method for determining
the migration distance ∆Rgal and midplane distance |z|
for each model stellar population. Our method produces
smoother distributions in chemical abundance space
than the simulation-based approach, but the abundance
distributions are otherwise unaffected by this change.
Table 1 summarizes our model parameters and the subsections in which we discuss them in detail.
2.1. Nucleosynthetic Yields
For simplicity and easier comparison to the results of
J21, we focus our analysis on O and Fe, representing the
α and Fe-peak elements, respectively. Both elements are
produced by CCSNe. VICE adopts the instantaneous recycling approximation for CCSNe, so the equation which
governs CCSN enrichment as a function of star formation for some element x is simply
M˙ CC
x
(t) = y
CC
x M˙
⋆(t) (1)
where y
CC
x
is the CCSN yield of element x per unit mass
of star formation, and M˙
⋆ is the SFR. Following J21,
who in turn adopt their CCSN yields from Chieffi &
Limongi (2004) and Limongi & Chieffi (2006), we adopt
y
CC
O = 0.015 and y
CC
Fe = 0.0012. The primary effect of
these yields is to set the low-[Fe/H] “plateau” in [O/Fe]
which represents pure CCSN enrichment. The chosen
yields for this paper produce a plateau at [O/Fe] = 0.45;
see Weinberg et al. (2023) for more discussion on the
effect of the CCSN yields on chemical evolution.
Following the formalism of Weinberg et al. (2017), the
rate of Fe contribution to the ISM from SNe Ia is

where ⟨M˙
⋆⟩Ia(t) is the time-averaged SFR weighted by

, tD is the
minimum SN Ia delay time, and tmax is the lifetime of
the disk. The denominator of Equation 3 is therefore
equal to NIa/M⋆, the total number of SNe Ia per M⊙ of
stars formed.
The yield y

(Maoz & Mannucci 2012). Adjusting the value of y

Fe
primarily affects the end point of chemical evolution
tracks in [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] space. Following J21, we adopt

Fe = 0.00214. This yield is originally adapted from the
W70 model of Iwamoto et al. (1999), but it is increased
slightly so that the inside-out SFH produces stars with
[O/Fe] ≈ 0.0 by the end of the model. The overall
scale of the yields is inconsequential: a lower value of

Ia yields on GCE models in detail.
2.2. Delay-Time Distributions
We explore five different functional forms for the DTD:
a two-population model, a single power-law, an exponential, a broken power-law with an initially flat plateau,
and a model computed from triple-system dynamics. We

also investigate one or two useful variations of the input
parameters for each functional form. Figure 1 presents
a selection of these DTDs, and Table 2 summarizes the
parameters and median delay times (tmed) for all of our
DTDs. We use simple forms rather than simulated physical or analytic models of SNe Ia for the sake of decreased computational time and easier interpretation of
the model predictions. Physically-motivated models of
the DTD must contend with many unknown or poorlyconstrained parameters, so our simplified forms have the
advantage of reducing the number of free parameters. In
Appendix B, we show that a few of our simple forms adequately approximate the more complete analytic models
of Greggio (2005).
In this subsection, we present functional forms of each
DTD in terms of a function fIa that has units of Gyr−1

which results in ∼ 40% of SNe Ia exploding within
t < 100 Myr. As we illustrate in Figure 1, the twopopulation DTD has a shorter median delay time than
most other models (except the power-law with α = −1.4,
not shown). This formulation is slightly different than
the approximation used in other GCE studies (e.g., Matteucci et al. 2006; Poulhazan et al. 2018), where it has a
more distinctly bimodal shape. We have compared the
two approximations to this DTD in a one-zone model
and found that they produce very similar abundance
distributions. This DTD was adopted by the Feedback
In Realistic Environments (FIRE; Hopkins et al. 2014)
and FIRE-2 (Hopkins et al. 2018) simulations.
Power-law —A single power law with slope α:

plaw
Ia (t) = (t/1 Gyr)α
(7)
A declining power-law with α ∼ −1 (Totani et al. 2008)
arises from typical assumptions about the distribution
of post-common envelope separations and the rate of
gravitational wave inspiral (see Section 3.5 from Maoz
et al. 2014). It is therefore a commonly assumed DTD
in GCE studies (e.g., Rybizki et al. 2017; J21; Weinberg
et al. 2023). Additionally, the observational evidence for
a power-law DTD is strong. Maoz & Graur (2017) obtained a DTD with α = −1.07±0.09 based on volumetric rates and an assumed cosmic SFH for field galaxies
in redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 2.25. Wiseman et al. (2021)
obtained a similar slope of α = −1.13 ± 0.05 for field
galaxies in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.6. Heringer
et al. (2019) used a SFH-independent method to constrain the DTD for field galaxies within 0.01 < z < 0.2
and found a larger value of α = −1.34+0.19
−0.17. For galaxy
clusters, Maoz & Graur (2017) found a steeper DTD
slope of α = −1.39+0.32
−0.05, and Friedmann & Maoz (2018)
found a similar slope of α = −1.3
+0.23
−0.16; however, a reanalysis by Freundlich & Maoz (2021) revealed no significant difference between the cluster and field galaxy
DTDs. In this paper, we investigate the cases α = −1.1
and α = −1.4.

This model allows analytic solutions to the abundances
as a function of time for some SFHs, making it a popular choice (e.g., Weinberg et al. 2017; Pantoni et al.
2019; Palicio et al. 2023). Sch¨onrich & Binney (2009)
and Weinberg et al. (2017) both assumed an exponential
DTD with a timescale τ = 1.5 Gyr. However, observational support for an exponential DTD is scarce. Strolger et al. (2020), fitting to the cosmic SFH and SFHs
from field galaxies, found a range of exponential-like solutions with timescales ∼ 1.5 − 6 Gyr. In this paper, we
investigate timescales τ = 1.5 and 3 Gyr. We show in
Appendix B that an exponential DTD with τ = 1.5 Gyr
is an adequate approximation for the analytic SD DTD
from Greggio (2005).
Plateau —A modification of the power-law in which the
DTD “plateaus” for a duration W before declining:
f
plat
Ia (t) =



1, t < W
(t/W)
α, t ≥ W.
(9)
Our primary motivation is to consider a model which
matches observations at delay times beyond a few Gyr,
where the DTD is best constrained, but with a smaller
fraction of prompt (≲ 100 Myr) SNe Ia than the single power law. This form has been used for the DTD
of neutron star mergers (Simonetti et al. 2019), but to
our knowledge it has not been considered for SNe Ia in
previous GCE models. We show in Appendix B that
this form can approximate the more complicated analytic DD DTDs from Greggio (2005). We investigate the
cases W = 0.3 Gyr and W = 1 Gyr, taking α = −1.1
for all plateau models.
Triple-system —A DTD based on simulations of triplesystem evolution by Rajamuthukumar et al. (2023). We
approximate their numerically-generated DTD as a special case of the plateau model (Equation 9) where the
initial rate is quite low until an instantaneous rise to the
plateau value at time trise:

(10)
with trise = 0.5 Gyr, W = 0.5 Gyr, α = −1.1, and
ϵ = 0.05 (i.e., the initial rate is 5% of the peak rate).
As illustrated in Figure 1, the triple-system DTD has
the longest median delay time out of all the models we
investigate.
There are many models for the DTD which have been
proposed in the literature, and an exhaustive test of every one is infeasible. In particular, we do not consider a
Gaussian DTD (e.g., Strolger et al. 2004), in which most
SNe Ia explode with delay times close to ∼ 3 Gyr and
there are very few prompt events. Evidence for this form
came from SN Ia rate measurements for z > 1, but reanalysis of the data revealed large errors due to the small
sample size, extinction corrections, and uncertainties in
the SFHs (e.g., F¨orster et al. 2006; Greggio et al. 2008).
Additionally, Mannucci et al. (2006) found that such a
DTD fails to reproduce the observed dependence of the
SN Ia rate on galaxy color, and there is evidence that at
least some SNe Ia must be prompt in order to explain
observed rates in spiral galaxies (e.g., Mannucci et al.
2005; Scannapieco & Bildsten 2005). GCE studies have
found that a Gaussian DTD over-produces high-[O/Fe]
and low-[Fe/H] stars (Matteucci et al. 2009; Palicio et al.
2023).
2.2.1. The Minimum SN Ia Delay Time
In addition to the DTD shape, the minimum SN Ia
delay time tD is another parameter that can have an
effect on chemical evolution observables, such as the location of the high-α knee and the [O/Fe] distribution
function (DF; Andrews et al. 2017). The value of tD is
set by the lifetime of the most massive SN Ia progenitor system. Previous GCE studies have adopted values
ranging from tD ≈ 30 Myr (e.g., Poulhazan et al. 2018)
to tD = 150 Myr (e.g., J21). We take tD = 40 Myr as
our fiducial value as it is the approximate lifetime of an
8 M⊙ star. In Section 3 we find that adopting a longer
tD has only a minor effect on the chemical evolution for
most DTDs except the power-law, but in that case the
effect of a longer tD can be approximated by adding an
initial plateau of width W = 0.3 Gyr to the DTD (see
Figure 4).
2.3. Star Formation Histories
We consider four models for the SFH, which we refer to as inside-out, late-burst, early-burst, and twoinfall. The former two models, which feature a smooth
SFH, were investigated by J21 using a similar methodology to this paper. The inside-out model produced
a good agreement to the age–[O/Fe] relation observed
by Feuillet et al. (2019), while the late-burst model
better matched their observed age–metallicity relation.
The latter two models feature discontinuous or “bursty”
SFHs. The early-burst model, proposed by Conroy et al.
(2022), uses an efficiency-driven starburst to explain the
break in the [α/Fe] trend observed in the H3 survey
(Conroy et al. 2019). The two-infall model was proposed by Chiappini et al. (1997) and features two distinct episodes of gas infall which produce the thick and
thin disks. Together, these four models cover a range
SN Ia DTD in GCE Models 7
of behavior, including a smooth SFH, and SFR-, SFE-,
and infall-driven starbursts.
The inside-out and late-burst models are run in VICE’s
“star formation mode,” where the SFR surface density
Σ˙
⋆ is prescribed along with the star formation efficiency
(SFE) timescale τ⋆ ≡ Σg/Σ˙
⋆. The remaining quantities,
infall rate surface density Σ˙
in and gas surface density Σg,
are calculated from the specified quantities assuming the
star formation law adopted by J21 (see their Equation
14). More specifically, at each timestep the infall rate is
calculated to fulfill the quantity of gas required to produce the specified SFR by the star formation law. The
latter two models are run in “infall mode,” where we
specify Σ˙
in and τ⋆. The initial gas mass is zero for all
models (including those run in star formation mode).
The mode in which VICE models are run makes no difference as a unique solution can always be obtained if
two of the four parametric forms are specified.
The SFH is normalized such that the model predicts
a total stellar mass of (5.17 ± 1.11) × 1010M⊙ (Licquia
& Newman 2015) and the stellar surface density gradient reported by Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard (2016, see
Appendix B of J21). We present an overview of the four
SFHs in Figure 2, and we discuss them individually here.
Inside-out —As in J21, this is our fiducial SFH. The
dimensionless time-dependence of the SFR is given by
fIO(t|Rgal) = h
1 − exp  −t
τrise
i exp  −t
τsfh(Rgal)

, (11)
where we assume τrise = 2 Gyr for all radii. The SFH
timescale τsfh varies with Rgal, with τsfh(Rgal = 8 kpc) ≈
15 Gyr at the solar annulus and longer timescales in the
outer Galaxy. The τsfh − Rgal relation is based on the
radial gradients in stellar age in Milky Way-like spirals
measured by S´anchez (2020, see Section 2.5 of J21 for
details).
Late-burst —A variation on the inside-out SFH with a
burst in the SFR at late times which is described by a
Gaussian according to
fLB(t|Rgal) = fIO(t|Rgal)

1 + Abe

b

, (12)
where Ab is the dimensionless amplitude of the starburst, tb is the time of the peak of the burst, and σb is
the width of the Gaussian. Evidence for a recent star
formation burst ∼ 2 − 3 Gyr ago has been found in
Gaia (Mor et al. 2019) and in massive WDs in the solar neighborhood (Isern 2019). Following J21, we adopt
Ab = 1.5, tb = 11.2 Gyr, and σb = 1 Gyr. The values
of τrise and τsfh(Rgal) are the same as in the inside-out
case.
Early-burst —An extension of the model proposed by
Conroy et al. (2022) to explain the non-monotonic behavior of the high-α sequence down to [Fe/H] ≈ −2.5.
This model features an abrupt factor ∼ 20 rise in the
SFE at early times, driving an increase in the [O/Fe]
abundance at the transition between the epochs of halo
and thick disk formation. Sahlholdt et al. (2022) found
evidence for a burst ∼ 10 Gyr ago which marks the beginning of a second phase of star formation. Mackereth
et al. (2018) found that an early infall-driven burst of
star formation can lead to a MW-like α-bimodality in
the EAGLE simulations (Crain et al. 2015; Schaye et al.
2015). We adopt the following formula for the timedependence of the SFE timescale from Conroy et al.
(2022):

50, t < 2.5 Gyr
50
[1+3(t−2.5)]2 , 2.5 ≤ t ≤ 3.7 Gyr
2.36, t > 3.7 Gyr.
(13)
While Conroy et al. (2022) used a constant infall rate
in their one-zone model, we adopt a radially-dependent
infall rate which declines exponentially with time:
fEB(t|Rgal) = exp  −t
τsfh(Rgal)

, (14)
where τsfh is the same as in the inside-out case. To calculate Σ˙
⋆ from the above quantities, we modify the fiducial
star formation law adopted from J21, substituting τEB
for the SFE timescale of molecular gas:

Two-infall —First proposed by Chiappini et al. (1997),
this model parameterizes the infall rate as two successive, exponentially declining bursts to explain the origin
of the high- and low-α disk populations:
fTI(t|Rgal) = N1(Rgal)e
−t/τ1 + N2(Rgal)e
−(t−ton)/τ2

(16)
where τ1 = 1 Gyr and τ2 = 4 Gyr are the exponential
timescales of the first and second infall, respectively, and
ton = 4 Gyr is the onset time of the second infall (based
on typical values in, e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997; Spitoni
et al. 2020, 2021). N1 and N2 are the normalizations of
the first and second infall, respectively, and their ratio

N2/N1 is calculated so that the thick-to-thin-disk surface density ratio fΣ(R) = Σ2(R)/Σ1(R) is given by
fΣ(R) = fΣ(0)e
R(1/R2−1/R1)
. (17)
Following Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard (2016), we adopt
values for the thick disk scale radius R1 = 2.0 kpc, thin
disk scale radius R2 = 2.5 kpc, and fΣ(0) = 0.27. We
note that most previous studies which use the two-infall
model (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997; Matteucci et al. 2006,
2009; Spitoni et al. 2019) do not consider gas outflows
and instead adjust the nucleosynthetic yields to reproduce the solar abundance. We adopt radially-dependent
outflows as in J21 (see their Section 2.4 for details) for
all our SFHs, including two-infall. We discuss the implications of this difference in Section 5.2.
2.4. Observational Sample
We compare our model results to abundance measurements from the final data release (DR17; Abdurro’uf
et al. 2022) of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; Majewski et al.
2017). APOGEE used infrared spectrographs (Wilson et al. 2019) mounted on two telescopes: the 2.5-
meter Sloan Foundation Telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) at
Apache Point Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere,
and the Ir´en´ee DuPont Telescope (Bowen & Vaughan
1973) at Las Campanas Observatory in the Southern
Hemisphere. After the spectra were passed through
the data reduction pipeline (Nidever et al. 2015), the
APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance
Pipeline (ASPCAP; Holtzman et al. 2015; Garc´ıa P´erez
et al. 2016) extracted chemical abundances using the
model grids and interpolation method described by
J¨onsson et al. (2020).
We restrict our sample to red giant branch and red
clump stars with high-quality spectra. Table 3 lists
our selection criteria, which largely follow from Hayden
§ et al. (2015). This produces a final sample of 171 635
õ
stars with calibrated [O/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundance measurements. We make use of the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) data (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016,
2021) included in the catalog by the APOGEE team.
Specifically, we use the Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) photogeometric distance estimates to calculate galactocentric
radius Rgal and midplane distance z, assuming a Sun–
Galactic center distance R⊙ = 8.122 kpc (GRAVITY
Collaboration et al. 2018) and height of the Sun above
the midplane z⊙ = 20.8 pc (Bennett & Bovy 2019). Table 4 lists the number of APOGEE stars in bins of Rgal
and |z|. For some Galactic regions with Rgal < 5 kpc
or Rgal > 13 kpc, the median distance error exceeds
1 kpc but remains within our bin width of 2 kpc, and
the vast majority of stars have much smaller distance
uncertainties.
We use estimated ages from Leung et al. (2023, hereafter L23), who use a variational encoder-decoder network which is trained on asteroseismic data to retrieve
age estimates for APOGEE giants without contamination from age-abundance correlations. Importantly, the
L23 ages do not plateau beyond ∼ 10 Gyr as they do
in astroNN (Mackereth et al. 2019). We use an age uncertainty cut of 40% per the recommendations of L23,
§ which produces a total sample of 57 607 APOGEE stars
õ
with age estimates. We note that we use the full sample
§ of 171 635 APOGEE stars unless we explicitly compare
õ
to age estimates. Table 5 presents the median and dispersion (95th − 5
th percentile difference) of the uncertainty in [Fe/H], [O/Fe], and log(age).
3. ONE-ZONE MODELS
Before running the full multi-zone models, it is useful
to understand the effects of the DTD in more idealized
conditions. A one-zone model assumes the entire gas
reservoir is instantaneously mixed, removing all spatial
dependence. This limits the ability to compare to observations across the disk, but it obviates the complicating
factor of stellar migration and better isolates the effects
of the nucleosynthesis prescription. In this section, we
compare the results from one-zone models which examine various parameters of the DTD while keeping other
parameters fixed. We use the outputs of our one-zone
models to identify the regions in chemical abundance
space which are most sensitive to the DTD.
For consistency, we adopt most of the parameter values from Table 1 for our one-zone models. We adopt
the inside-out SFR (Equation 11) evaluated at Rgal = 8
kpc (i.e., τrise = 2 Gyr and τsfh = 15.1 Gyr) and an
SFE timescale τ⋆ ≡ Mg/M˙
⋆ = 2 Gyr. Unless otherwise specified, we adopt an outflow mass-loading factor
η ≡ M˙
out/M˙
⋆ = 2.15 (see Equation 8 from J21) and a
minimum SN Ia delay time tD = 40 Myr.
3.1. DTD Parameters: Slope, Timescale, and Plateau
Width
The left-hand panel of Figure 3 compares the results
of three one-zone models that are identical except for the
slope of the power-law DTD. A steeper slope implies a
greater number of prompt SNe Ia which rapidly enrich
the ISM with Fe, producing a faster decline in [O/Fe]
with increasing [Fe/H] and hence a sharper “knee” after the minimum delay time. This results in a narrower
distribution of [O/Fe] around the low-α sequence and a
dearth of high-α stars. In all cases the [O/Fe] DF is distinctly unimodal. The MDF is not as strongly affected

which assume the various DTD shapes (see Figure 1). The open symbols along each curve mark logarithmic steps in time. The

SN Ia DTD in GCE Models 11
by the power-law slope: a shallower slope results in only
a modest increase in the width of the distribution. The
abundance tracks converge to the equilibrium value, reflecting the yield ratio of CCSNe to SNe Ia which is the
same in all models.
Similar trends can be seen when adjusting the
timescale of the exponential DTD, as shown in the middle panel of Figure 3. Here, the knee is not a sharp
feature associated with the onset of SNe Ia as in the
power-law case, but rather a gentle curve in the abundance track around t = 1 Gyr. Doubling the timescale
from 1.5 Gyr to 3 Gyr implies a longer median delay
time, which raises the [O/Fe] abundance ratio at t = 1
Gyr by ∼ 0.05 dex and at t = 3 Gyr by ∼ 0.1 dex.
A longer exponential timescale also produces a broader
[O/Fe] DF with more high-α stars, but the distribution
is still unimodal. The effect on the MDF is slightly
more pronounced than the power-law case, with longer
timescales skewing to lower [Fe/H] values.
Finally, the right-hand panel of Figure 3 shows the
effect of varying the width W of the plateau DTD. The
abundance tracks from several different plateau widths
fill the space in between the exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) and
power-law (α = −1.1 with no plateau) models, which are
both included in the panel for reference. The plateau
(W = 1 Gyr) and exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) DTDs produce nearly identical abundance tracks but their [O/Fe]
DFs are more distinct, illustrating the need for both observables to discriminate between DTDs. The effect on
the [O/Fe] DF is similar to the previous two models: a
longer plateau raises the median delay time, producing
a broader [O/Fe] DF and a more prominent high-α tail.
On the other hand, all of the plateau DTDs produce
very similar MDFs.
Unlike the previous three DTDs, we fix the hyperparameters of the two-population and triple-system
models to reproduce specific DTDs from the literature.
A variant of the two-population DTD with a broader
Gaussian component (tmax = 0.1 Gyr, σ = 0.03 Gyr)
produced similar abundance tracks and a nearly identical [O/Fe] distribution to the fiducial parametrization
in a one-zone model. The effect of different parameters for the triple-system DTD would be very similar to
the plateau DTD described above, of which the triplesystem DTD is a special case.
3.2. The Minimum SN Ia Delay Time
We also explore the effect of varying the minimum SN
Ia delay time tD (Section 2.2.1). The left-hand panel
of Figure 4 shows that tD has a much stronger effect
in models which assume a power-law DTD than others.
This is a consequence of the high number of prompt
SNe Ia (t ≲ 100 Myr; see Figure 1). Moreover, a powerlaw DTD with a long tD may be observationally hard
to distinguish from a plateau model. In Figure 4, the
abundance track for the model with a power-law DTD
and tD = 150 Myr (dashed purple line) is similar to
that of the plateau DTD with W = 0.3 Gyr and tD = 40
Myr (solid green line), and their [O/Fe] DFs are virtually
identical. For the exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) DTD, the two
values of tD produce nearly indistinguishable outputs.
We do not consider the effect on the other DTDs because
a 150 Myr minimum delay time is incompatible with
the two-population model, which has ∼ 50% of SNe Ia
explode in the first 100 Myr, and would have a negligible
effect on the triple-system DTD due to its low SN Ia rate
at short delay times. In the multi-zone models, we will
hold tD fixed at 40 Myr.
3.3. The Form of the DTD
The right-hand panel of Figure 4 compares the onezone model outputs from the full range of DTDs we investigate in this paper. As with the individual DTD parameters, the form of the DTD primarily affects the location of the high-α knee in the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] abundance
tracks. At one extreme is the triple-system model, which
sees the CCSN plateau extend up to [Fe/H] ≈ −0.8
followed by a sharp downward turn as the SN Ia rate
suddenly increases at a delay time of 500 Myr. At the
other extreme are the two-population and power-law
(α = −1.1) DTDs, for which the SN Ia rate peaks immediately after the minimum delay time of 40 Myr, placing
the high-α knee at [Fe/H] ≈ −1.8. The two-population
model has a unique second knee at [Fe/H] ≈ −0.2 and
[O/Fe] ≈ 0.1, which is produced by the delayed exponential component, as noted by Vincenzo et al. (2017).
The abundance tracks from the plateau (W = 1 Gyr)
and exponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) models occupy the intermediate space between these extremes.
The [O/Fe] DFs also show significant differences between the DTDs. In the triple-system model, star formation proceeds for such a long time before the knee that
the [O/Fe] DF shows a slight second peak around the
CCSN yield ratio (∼ 0.45 dex). Out of all our one-zone
models, this small bump is the only degree of bimodality that arises in the [O/Fe] DF. Below [O/Fe] ≈ 0.4,
the plateau (W = 1 Gyr) and triple-system DTDs produce nearly identical distributions, while the exponential DTD produces the narrowest distribution. The
power-law (α = −1.1) and two-population DTDs produce similar [O/Fe] DFs despite notably different abundance tracks. The exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) and plateau
(W = 0.3 Gyr) models, while not shown, produce similar
abundance tracks to the plateau (W = 1 Gyr) and ex-

ponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) models, respectively. The DTD
also slightly shifts the peak of the [O/Fe] DF, with the
exponential DTD placing it ∼ 0.02 dex lower than the
power-law DTD. We see similar trends in the MDF, but
to a lesser degree.
The results presented in this section indicate that the
[O/Fe]–[Fe/H] abundance tracks and the [O/Fe] DF are
most sensitive to the parameters of the DTD, while
the MDF is a less sensitive diagnostic. Degeneracies
between models in one regime can be resolved in the
other. For example, the exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) and
plateau (W = 1 Gyr) DTDs are indistinguishable in
[O/Fe]–[Fe/H] space but predict different [O/Fe] DFs.
Of course, both of these observables are also greatly affected by the parameters of the SFH. In this section
we focused on the fiducial inside-out SFH. Palicio et al.
(2023) compared similar DTDs in one-zone models with
a two-infall SFH (see Section 5.2).
4. MULTI-ZONE MODELS
We use the multi-zone GCE model tools in VICE developed by J21. The basic setup of our models follows
theirs. The disk is divided into concentric rings of width
δRgal = 100 pc. Stellar populations migrate radially
under the prescription we describe in Appendix C, but
each ring is otherwise described by a conventional onezone GCE model with instantaneous mixing (see discussion in Section 3). Following J21, we do not implement
radial gas flows (e.g., Lacey & Fall 1985; Bilitewski &
Sch¨onrich 2012). Stellar populations are also assigned a
distance from the midplane according to their age and
final radius as described in Appendix C.
We run our models with a time-step size of ∆t = 10
Myr up to a maximum time of tmax = 13.2 Gyr. Following J21, we set VICE to form n = 8 stellar populations
per ring per time-step, and we set a maximum starformation radius of RSF = 15.5 kpc, such that Σ˙
⋆ = 0
for Rgal > RSF. The model has a full radial extent of
20 kpc, allowing a purely migrated population to arise
in the outer 4.5 kpc. We adopt continuous recycling,
which accounts for the time-dependent return of mass
from all previous generations of stars (see Equation 2
from Johnson & Weinberg 2020). We summarize these
parameters in Table 1.
We run a total of multi-zone models with all combinations of our eight DTDs and four SFHs, for a total
of 32. In the following subsections, we present the stellar abundance and age distributions from the multi-zone
models and compare to APOGEE data from across the
Galactic disk.

range of midplane distance: 1 ≤ |z| < 2 kpc (top), 0.5 ≤ |z| < 1 kpc (middle), and 0 ≤ |z| < 0.5 kpc (bottom). Within each
panel, curves of different color represent the distributions of stars binned by Galactocentric radius Rgal, from 3 ≤ Rgal < 5 kpc
(yellow) to 13 ≤ Rgal < 15 kpc (blue). Each distribution is normalized so the area under the curve is 1, and the vertical scale is
consistent across each row. A Gaussian scatter with a width equal to the median observational uncertainty in APOGEE DR17
(see Table 5) is applied to the abundance of each model stellar population. For visual clarity, each MDF is smoothed with a
box-car width of 0.2 dex. Left columns: comparison between the inside-out and two-infall SFHs; both assume the exponential
(τ = 1.5 Gyr) DTD. Center column: the distributions from APOGEE DR17 for reference, binned and smoothed similarly. Right
columns: comparison between the power-law (α = −1.4) and exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) DTDs with the inside-out SFH. The
MDFs in the inner Galaxy show the greatest change between the DTDs (see discussion in Section 4.1). §

Figure 5 shows MDFs across the Galaxy for a selection of models and APOGEE data. The two left-hand
columns illustrate the effect of different SFHs on the
model outputs, which is most pronounced in the inner
Galaxy. Near the midplane and in the inner Galaxy, the
two-infall SFH produces a distinct bump ∼ 0.4 dex below the MDF peak, which is not seen for the inside-out
SFH. Away from the midplane, the low-metallicity tail
is slightly more prominent for the two-infall than the
inside-out model, and the two-infall MDFs extend to
slightly higher metallicity. In the outer Galaxy, though,
the MDFs produced by the two models are nearly identical. The shift in the skewness and peak of the MDF
from the inner to the outer Galaxy is unaffected by the
choice of SFH.
Holding the SFH fixed, varying the DTD has a minimal effect on the MDFs. The two right-hand columns
of Figure 5 plot the MDFs for two multi-zone models, which both assume an inside-out SFH but different
DTDs: a power-law with slope α = −1.4, and an exponential with timescale τ = 3 Gyr. The balance between
prompt and delayed SNe Ia is starkly different between
the two models, with ∼ 80% of explosions occurring
within 1 Gyr in the former but only ∼ 30% in the latter. However, the effect on the MDF is interestingly
small given this difference. The steep power-law leads
to an MDF at small Rgal that is only slightly narrower
than the extended exponential (made apparent by the
higher peak of the normalized MDF). This tracks with
our findings from one-zone models in Section 3 that the
DTD has a smaller effect on the MDF than other observables.
The inner Galaxy MDF is more sensitive to the choice
of DTD than the outer Galaxy. Here, the SFH peaks
earlier and declines more sharply due to the insideout formation of the disk. Consequently, SNe Ia often explode when the gas supply is significantly lower
than when the progenitors formed. This so-called “gas-
14 Dubay, Johnson, & Johnson
starved ISM” effect drives a faster increase in metallicity
(see analytic demonstration in Weinberg et al. 2017),
which ultimately lowers the number of low-metallicity
stars. The more extended the DTD, the stronger the
effect. The outer disk is less affected by the choice of
DTD, though, due to the more extended SFH.
To quantify the agreement between the MDFs generated by VICE and those observed in APOGEE, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback &
Leibler 1951), defined as
DKL(P||Q) ≡
Z ∞
−∞
p(x) log p(x)
q(x)

dx (18)
for distributions P and Q with probability density functions (PDFs) p(x) and q(x). If DKL = 0, the two distributions contain equal information. In this case, P is the
APOGEE MDF, Q is the model MDF, and x = [Fe/H].
We forward-model the observational uncertainties given
in Table 5 by applying a random Gaussian scatter to
the abundance of each model stellar population, and we
numerically evaluate Equation 18 with integration step
size d[Fe/H] = 0.01 dex. For each SFH and DTD, we
compute DKL in the 18 different Galactic regions shown
in Figure 5. We use bins in Rgal with a width of 2 kpc
between 3 and 15 kpc, and bins in midplane distance
of |z| = 0 − 0.5 kpc, 0.5 − 1 kpc, and 1 − 2 kpc. The
score S for the entire model is taken to be the average of
DKL for each region (Rgal, |z|) weighted by the number
of APOGEE stars in that region N⋆(Rgal, |z|) (see Table
4):
S =
P
Rgal ,|z| DKL(P||Q|Rgal, |z|)N⋆(Rgal, |z|)
P
Rgal ,|z| N⋆(Rgal, |z|)
. (19)
The model combination with the best (lowest) score
for the MDF is the two-infall SFH with the triple-system
DTD. The choice of SFH has a larger effect on the overall
score than the DTD, and the best-performing SFH is the
two-infall model. However, the difference between the
best-scoring model and the worst (inside-out SFH with
the α = −1.4 power-law DTD) is fairly small. While
there are some quantitative differences in how the shape
of the MDF varies with Galactic region, the qualitative
trends are unaffected by the choice of model SFH or
DTD. These trends are primarily driven by the assumption of chemical equilibrium, the abundance gradient,
and radial migration (see discussion in section 3.2 of
J21).
4.2. The distribution of [O/Fe]
The distribution of [O/Fe] serves as a record of the
relative rates of SNe Ia and CCSNe. As such, its shape
is affected by both the SFH and DTD. Figure 6 shows
the distribution of [O/Fe] across the disk for the four
model SFHs compared to the distributions measured by
APOGEE. All four models assume an exponential DTD
with τ = 1.5 Gyr, which has an intermediate median
delay time among all our DTDs. We see similar trends
with Galactic region across all four models. Near the
midplane, the distributions depend minimally on radius,
but away from the midplane, there is a clear trend toward higher [O/Fe] at small Rgal.
While trends with Rgal and |z| are similar across the
different models, the shape of the distribution varies
greatly with the chosen SFH. The inside-out and lateburst models produce similar distributions because of
the similarity of their underlying SFHs, as the burst
is imposed upon the inside-out SFH (see Equation 12).
Both skew heavily toward near-solar [O/Fe], although
the late-burst model produces a slightly broader peak
and a less-prominent high-[O/Fe] tail. This difference
arises because the late-burst SFH shifts a portion of the
stellar mass budget to late times when [O/Fe] is low.
The only region which shows any significant skew toward high [O/Fe] is Rgal = 3−5 kpc and |z| = 1−2 kpc,
but the shift to higher [O/Fe] at high latitudes is gradual
and does not produce the notable trough at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.2
which is seen in the APOGEE data.
On the other hand, the early-burst model produces a
bimodal [O/Fe] distribution in most regions. Although
agreement is not perfect, the early-burst SFH produces
the closest match to the data by far. In particular, the
low-α sequence away from the midplane is dominated
by stars in the solar annulus and outer disk, a trend
which is also seen in APOGEE. However, the early-burst
high-α sequence contains many stars in the outer disk
and close to the midplane, whereas the APOGEE distribution does not show a prominent high-α peak beyond
Rgal ∼ 11 kpc (∼ 7 kpc in the midplane).
The two-infall SFH produces three distinct modes at
[O/Fe] ≈ −0.05, 0.15, and 0.4. At small Rgal and with
increasing |z|, the low-α peak decreases in prominence
as the high-α peak increases, but the intermediate peak
is a striking feature at all latitudes that does not align
with observations. In the APOGEE data, the high-α
peak is at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.3, roughly halfway between the
intermediate and high-α peaks produced by the twoinfall model. However, the model high-α sequence does
match the observed trends with Rgal and |z| much better
than the early-burst models.
Figure 7 shows [O/Fe] distributions produced by models with the same SFH but a range of different DTDs.
We show models with the early-burst SFH because it
produces distinct low- and high-α sequences. The most

obvious effect of the DTD is to shift the mode of the
high-α sequence. The two-population DTD, which has
the most prompt SNe Ia, places the high-α sequence at
[O/Fe] ≈ 0.15, while the triple-system DTD, which has
the fewest prompt SNe Ia, places it ∼ 0.25 dex higher
at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.4. The plateau (W = 1 Gyr) DTD places
the higher peak at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.35, close to where it appears in the APOGEE distributions. However, the distance between the peaks of the APOGEE distributions
is only ∼ 0.2 dex, since the observed low-α sequence sits
at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.1. This spacing is best replicated by the
power-law (α = −1.1) DTD, even though both peaks
sit ∼ 0.1 dex too low and the distributions are narrower
than observed.
In general, models with fewer prompt SNe Ia populate the high-α sequence with more stars because the
chemical evolution track spends more time in the highα regime. This qualitatively agrees with the isolated
and cosmological simulations of Poulhazan et al. (2018),
who find that DTDs with a significant prompt component produce narrower [O/Fe] distributions and a higher
average [O/Fe].
We again compute the KL divergence (Equation 18) to
quantify the agreement between the [O/Fe] DFs of our
models and APOGEE. We calculate a score for each
model as described in Section 4.1. The best-scoring
model combines the inside-out SFH with the triplesystem DTD, and the plateau (W = 1 Gyr) and exponential (τ = 3 Gyr) DTDs score well when combined with either the inside-out or late-burst SFHs.
Both plateau DTDs also score relatively well with the
two-infall SFH. Surprisingly, the early-burst SFH scores
quite poorly for all DTD models, despite the fact that it
produces the most distinct high- and low-α sequences.
We discuss this further in Section 5.1.
4.3. Bimodality in [O/Fe]
The [O/Fe] distributions from APOGEE in Section
4.2 show two distinct peaks whose relative prominence
varies with Rgal and |z| (see also Figure 4 of Hayden
et al. 2015). A crucial feature of this bimodality, which
is not apparent in the analysis of the previous section,
is the presence of both sequences at fixed [Fe/H]. The
separation between the two sequences appears to be a
real feature and not an artifact of the APOGEE selection function (Vincenzo et al. 2021). A successful model
for the evolution of the Milky Way therefore must reproduce this bimodality.
Figure 8 compares the [O/Fe] distributions in the solar
annulus (7 ≤ Rgal < 9 kpc and 0 ≤ |z| < 2 kpc) in
two bins of [Fe/H] (−0.6 < [Fe/H] < −0.4 and −0.4 <
[Fe/H] < −0.2) for select model outputs and APOGEE
data. The purpose of the narrow [Fe/H] bins is to isolate
the bimodality of the [O/Fe] distribution with minimal
variation in [Fe/H]. The APOGEE distributions in the
bottom-right panel (j) show that the high-α mode is
more prominent at lower [Fe/H], but the distributions
in both bins are clearly bimodal. The “trough” occurs
near [O/Fe] ≈ 0.2 in each bin.
To quantify the strength of the α-bimodality, we use
the peak-finding algorithm scipy.signal.find peaks
(Virtanen et al. 2020). For each peak, we calculate the
prominence, or the vertical distance between a peak and
its highest neighboring trough. We consider a distribution bimodal if both peaks exceed an arbitrary threshold
of 0.1. The APOGEE distributions exceed this threshold in both [Fe/H] bins.
The top row of panels (a–e) in Figure 8 shows the
[O/Fe] bimodality (or lack thereof) across five different DTDs, all of which assume the late-burst SFH. To
better approximate the APOGEE selection function, we
re-sample our model stellar populations so the |z| distribution closely matches that of APOGEE in the solar neighborhood. Six of the eight DTDs (all except
the two-infall and α = −1.4 power-law DTDs) exceed
our prominence threshold in the low-[Fe/H] bin. Panel
(a) shows that the two-infall DTD produces a marginal
low-α peak, although it does not meet the prominence
threshold. In general, DTDs with fewer prompt SNe Ia
produce a high-α peak which is more prominent and at
a higher [O/Fe], as was the case with the [O/Fe] distributions in Section 4.2.
Panels (f)–(i) in the bottom row of Figure 8 illustrate
the effect of the SFH on the [O/Fe] bimodality. The
inside-out SFH does not produce a bimodal distribution
for most of our DTDs (the exception is the W = 1 Gyr
plateau DTD, which produces a much smaller trough
than observed). On the other hand, the early-burst
SFH always produces a bimodal distribution in the high-
[Fe/H] bin regardless of the assumed DTD, but not in
the low-[Fe/H] bin (the small low-α peak falls below our
prominence threshold). For models with the late-burst
and two-infall SFHs, the bimodality in the low-[Fe/H]
bin is variable depending on the DTD: those with longer
median delay times (e.g., exponential, plateau, or triplesystem) generally produce a bimodal distribution, while
the two DTDs with the most prompt SNe Ia do not.
One major problem in all of our models is the presence of the [α/Fe] bimodality across only a narrow range
of [Fe/H]. Even our most successful models can produce a bimodal [O/Fe] distribution in only one bin:
the high-[Fe/H] bin for the early-burst SFH, and the
low-[Fe/H] bin for the late-burst and two-infall SFHs.

[Fe/H] ≈ −0.6, below which the high-α sequence dominates, and [Fe/H] ≈ +0.2, at which point they join. The
failure of these models to fully reproduce the bimodality
across the whole range of [Fe/H] was noted by J21, and
the problem persists for each model we consider here.
4.4. The [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] Plane
In Section 3, we illustrated that the form and parameters of the DTD have an important effect on the ISM
abundance tracks in idealized one-zone models (see Figures 3 and 4). However, comparisons to data are limited
because the tracks neither record the number of stars
that formed at each abundance, nor incorporate the effect of stellar migration. Here, we present the distribution of stellar abundances in the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane
alongside the ISM abundance tracks from our multi-zone
models. We compare our model outputs to the observed
distributions from APOGEE across the Milky Way disk.
Figure 9 compares the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane in the solar neighborhood (7 ≤ Rgal < 9 kpc, 0 ≤ |z| < 0.5 kpc)
between our four model SFHs. The black curves represent the ISM abundance as a function of time in the
Rgal = 8.0 − 8.1 kpc zone; in the absence of radial migration, all model stellar populations would lie close to
these lines. Stellar populations to the left of the abundance tracks were born in the outer disk, while those to
the right were born in the inner disk, as illustrated by
the color-coding in the figure. Much of the scatter in
[Fe/H] in a given Galactic region can be attributed to
radial migration (Edvardsson et al. 1993).
The tracks predicted by all four SFHs initially follow a similar path of decreasing [O/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H]. The ISM abundance ratios of the inside-out
model change monotonically over the entire disk lifetime. The stellar abundance distribution at both lowand high-[O/Fe] is composed of stars with a wide range
of birth Rgal.
The late-burst model produces similar results to the
inside-out model up to [Fe/H] ≈ −0.2 due to their similar SFHs. The Gaussian burst in its SFH introduces a
loop in the ISM abundance track, as an uptick in star
formation at t ≈ 11 Gyr raises the CCSN rate, leading
to a slight increase in [O/Fe] before the subsequent increase in the SN Ia rate lowers the [O/Fe] once again
(see e.g. Figure 1 of Johnson & Weinberg 2020). This
loop slightly broadens the low-[O/Fe] stellar distribution
as we observed in Section 4.2.
This same pattern is seen much more strongly in the
abundance tracks for the two-infall model. Here, the
significant infall of pristine gas at t = 4 Gyr leads to
rapid dilution of the metallicity of the ISM, followed
by a large burst in the SFR, which raises [O/Fe] by
∼ 0.2 dex. We observe a ridge in the stellar abundance
distribution at the turn-over point ([O/Fe] ≈ 0.15) associated with SNe Ia whose progenitors formed during

the burst. This ridge roughly coincides with the upper
limit of the APOGEE distribution near the midplane.
The three-peaked structure of the [O/Fe] distributions
in Section 4.2 is explained by the abundance tracks here:
a small population of stellar populations at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.4
is produced initially, followed by the middle peak when
the abundance track turns over, and finally the peak at
[O/Fe] ≈ −0.1 which reflects the equilibrium abundance
ratio of the second infall.
The early-burst track is the most distinct from the
other models at low metallicity. The portion shown in
Figure 9 represents the evolution after the early SFE
burst. At low metallicity, there is a “simmering phase”
where [O/Fe] slowly decreases to a local minimum at
[Fe/H] ≈ −1.3, at which point the rapid increase in the
SFE causes the [O/Fe] to rebound (a more thorough examination of this behavior can be found in Conroy et al.
2022). The early-burst SFH produces the clearest separation between a high- and low-[O/Fe] sequences. The
number of stars on the high-[O/Fe] sequence is relatively
high, likely as a result of its higher SFR at early times
compared to the other models.
Figure 10 compares the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] ISM tracks and
stellar distributions for five models with the same SFH
but different DTDs. We choose the inside-out SFH for
this figure because it predicts monotonically-decreasing
abundance ratios, making comparisons between the different DTDs relatively straightforward. The models are
arranged according to the median delay time of the
DTD, increasing across the panel columns from left to
right.
The two-population and power-law (α = −1.1) DTDs,
which have a large fraction of prompt (t ≲ 100 Myr) SNe
Ia, produce stellar abundance distributions that are reasonably well-aligned with the APOGEE contours at low
|z|, but they entirely miss the observed high-α sequence
at large |z|. The ISM abundance tracks for the 8 kpc
zone do not pass through the APOGEE 30% contour at
|z| = 1 − 2 kpc. For both DTDs, the high-[O/Fe] knee
is located below the left-most bound of the plot, but we
observe a second knee at [O/Fe] ≈ 0.15 where the abundance tracks turn downward once more. As discussed
in Section 3, the second knee is most prominent in the
model with the two-population DTD because of its long
exponential tail.
The exponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) DTD, which has an
intermediate median delay time, produces a distribution in Figure 10 which aligns quite well with the 80%
APOGEE contours in all |z|-bins, and even produces
a “ridge” which extends to high [O/Fe] at low- and
mid-latitudes (bottom and center panels, respectively).
While it does better at populating the high-α sequence
than the previous DTDs, the bulk of the model stellar
populations at large |z| still fall below the APOGEE
30% contour.
The two right-hand columns present model results
for the plateau (W = 1 Gyr) and triple-system DTDs,
which have the longest median delay times. The high-
[O/Fe] knee occurs at a much higher metallicity in these
models and is visible in the gas abundance tracks in
the upper-left corner of the panels. At large |z|, the
predicted abundance distributions align quite well with
the APOGEE high-α sequence, but there is a significant
ridge of high-α stars from the inner Galaxy at low |z|.
To quantify the agreement between the multi-zone
model outputs and data in [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] space, we implement the method of Perez-Cruz (2008) for estimating
the KL divergence between two continuous, multivariate samples using a k-nearest neighbor estimate. For n
samples from a multivariate PDF p(x) and m samples
from q(x), we can estimate DKL(P||Q) according to the

where d = 2 is the dimension of the sample space and

in the samples of P and Q, respectively.
We take k = 2 to find the nearest neighbor other than
the sample itself. As before, P is the APOGEE distribution and Q is the model distribution, and in this case
x = ([Fe/H], [O/Fe]), without applying any scaling factor to each dimension. As in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we bin
the model outputs and data by Rgal and |z|, calculate
Dˆ
k(P||Q) in each region, and then take the weighted
mean of each region as in Equation 19 to arrive at a
single score for each model.
The best-scoring model combines the triple-system
DTD with the inside-out SFH. The two other DTDs
with the longest median delay times, plateau (W = 1
Gyr) and exponential (τ = 3 Gyr), also score quite
well. As with the [O/Fe] DFs, the inside-out and lateburst SFH models score similarly across all DTDs in
the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane. The early-burst SFH models
score the worst out of all the SFHs, likely due to the
long “tail” in the distribution down to low [Fe/H] which
is not seen in the APOGEE data.
Figure 11 plots the stellar [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] abundances
from the model with the two-infall SFH and plateau
(W = 1 Gyr) DTD in two different bins of Rgal. In the
inner Galaxy, the model distribution at large |z| lies at
higher [O/Fe] and is more extended than the APOGEE
distribution. Agreement between the model and data is
worst at mid-latitudes: the model distribution is sparsest in the area of the peak of the APOGEE distribution.
Near the midplane, however, the model output is wellaligned with the data. In the outer Galaxy, the distributions are well-aligned at all |z|, though the model distributions are more extended along the [O/Fe] axis than
in the data. Adjustments to the yields or the relative infall strengths could improve the agreement between the
two-infall model output and the observed distributions.

4.5. The Age–[O/Fe] Plane
As demonstrated by our one-zone models in Section 3,
models that produce similar tracks in abundance space
can be distinguished by the rate of their abundance evolution. We therefore expect the age–[O/Fe] relation to
be a useful diagnostic. Figure 12 shows the stellar age
and [O/Fe] distributions in the solar neighborhood for
each of our four SFHs. As in Figure 9, all four panels assume an exponential DTD with τ = 1.5 Gyr. We
compare these predictions against ages estimated with
L23’s variational encoder-decoder algorithm. We caution against drawing strong conclusions from this comparison, because we do not correct for selection effects
or systematic errors in the age determination.
The inside-out and late-burst models show fair agreement with the data at high [O/Fe], although both show a
∼ 2 Gyr offset. One could shift the ramp-up in star formation to slightly later times or simply run the model for
a shorter amount of time to close this gap. Although it is

the exponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) DTD. Each panel plots a
random mass-weighted sample of 10,000 star particles in
the solar neighborhood (7 ≤ Rgal < 9 kpc, 0 ≤ |z| < 0.5
kpc) color-coded by [Fe/H]. A Gaussian scatter has been applied to all points based on the median [O/Fe] error from
APOGEE DR17 and the median age error from L23 (see Table 3). Black squares represent the mass-weighted median
age of star particles within bins of [O/Fe] with a width of
0.05 dex, and the horizontal black error bars encompass the
16th and 84th percentiles. Red triangles and horizontal error
bars represent the median, 16th, and 84th percentiles of age
from L23, respectively. For clarity, bins which contain less
than 1% of the total mass (in the models) or total number
of stars (in the data) are not plotted. §

a visually striking difference, the age at the high-[O/Fe]
knee is not a good diagnostic for the SFH after factoring in the age uncertainties. As in the data, the trend in
the median age with decreasing [O/Fe] decreases monotonically in the inside-out model. The late-burst model,
however, shows a bump in the relation at a lookback
time of ∼ 2 Gyr which is not seen in the data, as noted
by J21.
For the early-burst SFH, the predicted stellar ages are
almost perfectly aligned with the data for [O/Fe] ≳ 0.2.
The rapid rise in the SFE at early times delays the
descent to lower [O/Fe] values and produces a clump
of low-metallicity, high-[O/Fe] stars at an age of ∼ 10
Gyr. Lastly, the two-infall SFH produces a fair match
to the data. Stars with [O/Fe] ≳ 0.25 were produced in
the first infall, while the second infall produces a clump
of stars with similar metallicity, ages of ∼ 8 Gyr, and
[O/Fe] ≈ 0.2. There is a population of old, low-α stars
that arise due to the initial descent in [O/Fe] prior to
SN Ia DTD in GCE Models 21
the second accretion epoch. The subsequent increase
in [O/Fe] does not produce as strong of a bump as the
late-burst SFH, because it occurs much earlier and is
therefore narrower in log(age). However, the two-infall
SFH produces [O/Fe] abundances for the youngest stars
which are roughly 0.1 dex lower than the other models.
In contrast to J21, none of our models predict a population of young, α-enhanced stars in the solar neighborhood. These stars have been observed in APOGEE (e.g.,
Martig et al. 2016; Silva Aguirre et al. 2018) and many
are likely old systems masquerading as young stars due
to mass transfer or a merger (e.g., Yong et al. 2016), but
it is not known whether some fraction are truly intrinsically young (Hekker & Johnson 2019). In J21, these
young, α-enhanced stars are the result of a highly variable SN Ia rate in the outer Galaxy. The SN Ia progenitors migrate before they are able to enrich their birth annulus, so the subsequent stellar populations are depleted
in Fe. Two differences in the migration scheme explain
the lack of these stars in our own models: first, we
adopt a time-dependence for radial migration of ∆t
1/3
,
which is slower than the diffusion scheme (∆t
1/2
) of J21.
Second, our migration method is designed to produce
smooth abundance distributions, whereas the method
of J21 can assign identical migration patterns to many
stellar populations in sparsely-populated regions of the
Galaxy, potentially removing many SN Ia progenitors
from a given zone simultaneously (for more discussion,
see Appendix C). This update to the model is consistent with Grisoni et al.’s (2024) finding that young αrich stars have similar occurrence rates across the disk,
which supports a stellar, as opposed to Galactic, origin.
Figure 13 shows the predicted age–[O/Fe] relation for
five of our DTDs. All models were run with the earlyburst SFH because it predicts the clearest separation
between the high- and low-α sequences (see Figure 12).
Similar to Figure 10, models are arranged from left to
right by increasing median SN Ia delay time. The high-α
sequence moves to higher [O/Fe] with increasing median
delay time, from ∼ 0.2 for the two-population model to
∼ 0.4 for the triple-system DTD. As we have seen in
previous figures, the range in [O/Fe] produced by DTD
models with many prompt SNe Ia is much smaller than
the extended DTDs. At high |z| (top row), the observed
range of [O/Fe] is larger than what is produced by most
of our models. While the plateau (W = 1 Gyr) and
triple-system models come close, the other three fall
short of the observed range in [O/Fe], but still closely
match the median age–[O/Fe] relation. There is a slight
reversal in the observed trend for the stars with the highest [O/Fe]: the 0.45 ≤ [O/Fe] < 0.5 bin has a slightly
lower median age than the 0.3 ≤ [O/Fe] < 0.35 bin at
high |z| in the L23 sample, a small effect but one which
is not predicted by any of our models.
Moving to stars at low |z|, the plateau (W = 1
Gyr) and triple-system DTDs over-produce stars at the
old, high-α end of the distribution, while also diverging
somewhat from the observed sequence near solar [O/Fe].
The exponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) DTD comes closest to reproducing the observed range in [O/Fe], while the two
DTDs with the shortest median delay time once again
produce a smaller range of [O/Fe] than observed. We
note that the break between the linear and flat parts
of the relation is sharpest for the exponential DTD,
and a more gradual transition is observed for the other
four DTDs. This difference arises because the exponential DTD is most dominant at intermediate delay times
(t ∼ 1 − 3 Gyr) but falls off much faster than the other
models at long delay times, so [O/Fe] is close to constant
for lookback times ≲ 5 Gyr. Overall, the exponential
(τ = 1.5 Gyr) DTD most closely matches the data for
stars with 0 ≤ |z| < 0.5 kpc.
We use a different scoring system from previous subsections due to the much larger uncertainties in age than
[O/Fe]. As shown in Figures 12 and 13, in each Galactic
region we sort the model outputs and data into bins
of [O/Fe] with a width of 0.05 dex. We define the root
mean square (RMS) median age difference for the region
as
∆τRMS ≡
sP
k ∆τ
2
k
nL23,k
nL23,tot
(21)
where ∆τk = med(τVICE) − med(τL23) is the difference
between the mass-weighted median age in VICE and the
median stellar age from L23 in bin k, nL23,k is the number of stars from the L23 age sample in bin k, and
nL23,tot is the total number of stars in the sample in
that Galactic region. This is similar to a reduced χ
2
estimator except that the difference in medians is not
weighted by the variance in the observed sample. If a
bin has no modeled or observed stars, we do not calculate ∆τk for that bin. As before, the score for the model
as a whole is the average of ∆τRMS across all regions,
weighted by the number of stars with age measurements
in each region.
The best (lowest-scoring) model in the age–[O/Fe]
plane is the triple-system DTD with the two-infall SFH.
Models which score almost as well are the plateau (W =
1 Gyr) and triple-system DTDs with either the earlyburst or two-infall SFH. Visually, the non-monotonic
bump in the age–[O/Fe] relation produced by the lateburst SFH does not match the observed distribution,
but it actually improves ∆τRMS by lowering the median
age of stars in the low-[O/Fe] bins. If the shape of the
distribution is taken into account, the late-burst SFH

produces the worst match to the data. We discuss the
quantitative scores in further Section 5.1 below.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Qualitative Comparisons
In Section 4, we focused on a representative subset of
our 32 multi-zone models (four SFHs and eight DTDs).
Here, we compare all of our model outputs to APOGEE
across five observables: the MDF, [O/Fe] DF, [O/Fe]–
[Fe/H] plane, age–[O/Fe] plane, and [O/Fe] bimodality.
We perform statistical tests between APOGEE and the
model outputs in each region of the Galaxy as described
in corresponding subsections of Section 4, then compute
the average weighted by the size of the APOGEE sample
in each region to obtain a single numerical score.
The relative performance of each model is summarized
in Table 6. We use these scores to indicate combinations
of SFH and DTD that are favorable or unfavorable in
certain regimes, but we do not fit our models to the
data due to computational expense. To avoid drawing
strong conclusions from small numerical differences in
scores, we simply write ✓, ∼, or ×, which corresponds
to a score in the top, middle, or bottom third out of
all models, respectively. The exact numerical scores are
presented in Appendix D.
Some of the variation between models can be explained by the choice of SFH. The two-infall models tend
to out-perform the others for the MDFs, while the lateburst models score poorly, especially with the prompt
DTDs. The early-burst models consistently have the
lowest scores for the [O/Fe] DF and [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] distribution, but are able to produce a bimodal [O/Fe] distribution with every DTD (see discussion in Section 4.3).
The late-burst and two-infall SFHs also produce a bimodal [O/Fe] distribution with all DTDs except those
with the highest prompt fraction, while the inside-out
models never produce bimodality. The inside-out models also tend score poorly in the age–[O/Fe] plane, while
the early-burst models tend to score well, although as
discussed in Section 4.5, adjusting the time of the peak

SFR or running the models for a shorter period of time
would affect the level of agreement in the high-[O/Fe]
bins.
It is somewhat surprising that the early-burst models
score poorly against the APOGEE [O/Fe] DFs, given
that they produce the clearest bimodal distributions.
The KL divergence test heavily penalizes models with
a high density in a region where the observations have
little, as is the case for the high-α sequence in the outer
Galaxy and close to the midplane (see Figure 6). This
similarly explains the early-burst models’ poor performance in the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane. An iteration of this
SFH where the early burst predominantly affects the inner galaxy is probably more accurate and might have
more success at reproducing the [O/Fe] DF across the
disk.
The choice of DTD has a clear effect on the model
scores, and this effect is similar for most of the observables. The models which perform the best (most ✓’s and
fewest ×’s) are the most extended DTDs with the fewest
prompt SNe Ia: both plateau DTDs, the exponential
DTD with τ = 3 Gyr, and the triple-system DTD. The
latter actually produces the highest scores for each observable, but the plateau DTD with W = 1 Gyr is the
most successful across all SFHs; both models have some
of the longest median delay times. Models with a large
24 Dubay, Johnson, & Johnson
fraction of prompt SNe Ia, such as the power-law and
two-population DTDs, fare quite poorly, with the steepest power-law (α = −1.4) and two-population DTDs
ending up in the bottom third across the board for most
of our SFHs. The fiducial power-law (α = −1.1) does
slightly better, but still compares poorly to the more
extended DTDs.
Each DTD tends to score similarly across the board,
but there are some combinations of SFH and DTD
that buck the general trend. For example, the twopopulation DTD with the early-burst SFH produces an
MDF which scores relatively well. The early-burst models generally produce MDFs in the ∼ category, so a small
increase in the numerical score bumps it up to ✓; this indicates the insensitivity of the MDF to the DTD in general. The exponential DTD with τ = 1.5 Gyr has generally middling performance, but does a notably poorer
job when combined with the early-burst SFH, a result
of the generally poor performance of that SFH.
The plateau DTD with W = 1 Gyr, our most successful model overall, poorly reproduces the MDF with
the late-burst SFH, while the exponential DTD with
τ = 3 Gyr produces better agreement with the data for
that SFH. Finally, the inside-out SFH generally does
not reproduce the APOGEE age–[O/Fe] relation well,
but it scores better than average when combined with
the triple-system DTD.
Our model scores are highly sensitive to small changes
in the nucleosynthetic yields. A decrease in the SN Ia
yield of Fe to y
Ia
Fe = 0.0017, which shifts the end-point of
the gas abundance tracks up by ∼ +0.05 dex in [O/Fe],
produces dramatically different scores for many of the
models. This is because the KL divergence tests penalize
distributions which are not well aligned with the data,
even if the general trends and shape of the distribution
are reproduced. For example, if the two-infall models are
run with y
Ia
Fe = 0.0017, the abundance tracks do not dip
below solar [O/Fe] (see the bottom-right panel of Figure
9) and consequently they out-score every other SFH.
Small adjustments in the yields can affect the quality of
the fit between our models and the data, so we caution
against over-interpreting the qualitative comparisons in
Table 6.
We also run a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
test on the model [Fe/H] and [O/Fe] DFs to estimate
the significance of the agreement with the observed distributions. However, we consistently reject the null hypothesis that the model and observed abundances are
drawn from the same distribution at very high significance (p << 0.05) in each Galactic region. The large
sample size means that even small deviations from the
APOGEE distribution result in a very small p-value,
making the KS test a poor diagnostic for model comparison. Overall, this reinforces the conclusion that even
our best-performing models cannot reproduce all observations.
5.2. The Two-Infall SFH
There have been many comparative GCE studies of
the DTD with the two-infall model, providing an important point of comparison with our models. For example, Matteucci et al. (2006) explored the consequences of
the two-population DTD (Mannucci et al. 2006), finding that its very high prompt SN Ia rate began to pollute the ISM during the halo phase and led to a faster
decline in [O/Fe] with [Fe/H]. Matteucci et al. (2009)
compared several DTDs, including the analytic forms of
Greggio (2005) and the two-population DTD, in a multizone GCE model of the disk. Their comparisons to data
were limited to the solar neighborhood, and unlike our
models, they did not factor in radial migration or gas
outflows. Nevertheless, their conclusions align fairly well
with ours: a relatively low fraction of prompt SNe Ia is
needed to produce good agreement with observations.
More recently, Palicio et al. (2023) compared a similar suite of DTDs in one-zone models with a two-infall
SFH. In contrast to previous studies of the two-infall
model (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997; Matteucci et al. 2009;
Spitoni et al. 2021), they did incorporate gas outflows,
making their models especially well-suited to compare
to ours. By modifying their yields, outflow mass-loading
factor, and some of the parameters of their SFH, Palicio et al. (2023) were able to achieve a good fit to solar
neighborhood abundance data for both the SD and DD
analytic DTDs, which are approximated by our exponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) and plateau (W = 1 Gyr) models,
respectively. Our results and theirs highlight the need
for independent constraints on the SFH to resolve degeneracies with the DTD.
To our knowledge, this paper is the first exploration
of the two-infall SFH in a multi-zone GCE model which
incorporates both mass-loaded outflows and radial migration. A detailed examination of the parameters of
the two-infall model is beyond the scope of this paper
but will be the subject of future work.
5.3. Extragalactic Constraints
The power-law (α = −1.1) DTD has the strongest observational motivation but poorly reproduces the disk
abundance distributions. This can be mitigated somewhat with a longer minimum delay time, which has a
similar effect on chemical evolution tracks as the addition of an initial plateau in the DTD (see discussion in
Section 3). Even so, it is clear that the high fraction of
SN Ia DTD in GCE Models 25
prompt SNe Ia in extragalactic constraints on the DTD
by, e.g., Maoz & Graur (2017) is at odds with Galactic
chemical abundance measurements.
This tension could suggest that the Milky Way obeys
a different DTD than other galaxies. This would not
be too far beyond Maoz & Graur’s (2017) finding that
field galaxies and galaxy clusters have a different DTD
slope. However, Walcher et al. (2016) argued that the
similarity of the age–[α/Fe] relation between solar neighborhood stars and nearby elliptical galaxies is evidence
for a universal DTD. A physical mechanism would be
needed to produce a different slope or form for the DTD
in different environments, such as a metallicity dependence in the fraction of close binaries (e.g., Moe et al.
2019).
On the other hand, the difference between constraints
from GCE models and extragalactic surveys indicates
that these types of studies are most sensitive to different
regimes of the DTD. Our results demonstrate that the
high-α sequence in GCE models is highly sensitive to the
DTD at short delay times. Measurements of galactic or
cosmic SFHs typically provide constraints for the DTD
in coarse age bins, with especially large uncertainties in
the youngest bins (e.g., Maoz & Mannucci 2012), and
it is difficult to constrain the SFH of individual galaxies at long lookback times (Conroy 2013). Additionally,
measurements of the cosmic SN Ia rate become considerably uncertain at z ≳ 1 (see, e.g., Palicio et al. 2024).
As a result, constraints from external galaxies should be
more sensitive to the DTD at long delay times.
Palicio et al. (2024) fit combinations of cosmic star
formation rates (CSFRs) and DTDs, many of which are
similar to the forms in this paper, to the observed cosmic
SN Ia rate. Notably, the DTD that best fit the majority of their CSFRs was the single-degenerate DTD of
Matteucci & Recchi (2001), which is similar to the exponential form with τ = 1.5 Gyr (see Appendix B for
more discussion). They were able to exclude DTDs with
a very high or very low fraction of prompt SNe Ia, but a
number of their DTDs could produce a convincing fit to
the observed rates with the right CSFR. Despite a very
different methodology, their results mirror ours: that
many forms for the DTD can produce a reasonable fit
to the data when combined with the right SFH.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have explored the consequences of eight different
forms for the SN Ia DTD in multi-zone GCE models
with radial migration. For each DTD, we explored combinations with four different popular SFHs from the literature, which represent a broad range of behavior over
the lifetime of the disk seen in many prior GCE models.
We compared our model outputs to abundances from
APOGEE and ages from L23 for stars across the Milky
Way disk. For each model, we computed a numerical
score that reflects the agreement between the predictions
and data across the entire disk for five observables. Our
main conclusions are as follows:
• While some combinations of SFH and DTD perform better than others, none of our models are
able to reproduce every observed feature of the
Milky Way disk.
• The plateau DTD with a width W = 1 Gyr is
best able to reproduce the observed abundance
patterns for three of the four SFHs. For the insideout SFH, it is narrowly surpassed by the (similar)
triple-system DTD.
• In general, we favor a DTD with a small fraction
of prompt SNe Ia. The models with exponential,
plateau, and triple-system DTDs perform significantly better than the models with two-population
and power-law DTDs across all four SFHs.
• The observationally-derived t
−1.1 power-law DTD
produces too few high-α stars. This could be mitigated with a longer minimum delay time or the
addition of an initial plateau in the DTD at short
delay times.
• The SFH is the critical factor for producing a bimodal [α/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H]. On its
own, the DTD cannot produce a bimodal [α/Fe]
distribution that matches what is observed. However, it does affect the location and strength of the
high-α sequence, potentially enhancing the [α/Fe]
bimodality resulting from the choice of SFH.
The origin of the Milky Way’s [α/Fe] bimodality remains disputed. Some authors have argued that the
combination of inside-out growth and radial migration sufficiently explains the observed distribution (e.g.,
Kubryk et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2023;
Prantzos et al. 2023), while others have argued that multiple episodes of gas infall at early times are required
(e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997; Mackereth et al. 2018; Spitoni et al. 2019, 2020, 2021). In agreement with J21, we
find that a smooth SFH combined with radial migration
does not suffice. We find that these parameter choices
predict too many stars between the high- and low-α sequences, resulting in a broad but unimodal [α/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H].
We found that the MDF is least able to provide constraints on the DTD. The MDF is more sensitive to the
26 Dubay, Johnson, & Johnson
SFH, but overall trends across the Galaxy are primarily
driven by the assumed radial abundance gradient and
stellar migration prescription. However, the MDF is
more sensitive to the DTD in the inner Galaxy due to
the more sharply declining SFH (see discussion in Section 4.1). Under the model of inside-out formation, the
MDF in the inner Galaxy traces older populations which
are more sensitive to the enrichment of prompt SNe Ia.
We implemented a stellar migration scheme which reproduces the abundance trends seen in the models of
J21, but produces smoother abundance distributions.
Our method is flexible and is not tied to the output
of a single hydrodynamical simulation. In future work,
we will explore the effect of the strength and speed of
radial migration on GCE models.
Recent studies have shown that the high specific SN
Ia rates observed in low-mass galaxies (e.g., Brown et al.
2019; Wiseman et al. 2021) can be explained by a
metallicity-dependent rate of SNe Ia (Gandhi et al. 2022;
Johnson et al. 2023a). A similar metallicity dependence
has also been observed in the rate of CCSNe (Pessi et al.
2023). These previous investigations varied only the normalization in the DTD. Gandhi et al. (2022) take into
account radial migration by construction through their
use of the FIRE-2 simulations. An exploration in the
context of multi-zone models would be an interesting direction for future work, as would variations in the DTD
shape.
Our results indicate that the allowed range of parameter space in GCE models is still too broad to precisely
constrain the DTD. Future constraints may come from
the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the
Vera Rubin Observatory (Ivezi´c et al. 2019), which is expected to observe several million SNe during its 10-year
run. On the other hand, the improved sample size of
SDSS-V (Kollmeier et al. 2017) will enable future GCE
studies to constrain both the Galactic SFH and the DTD
at a higher confidence.

B. ANALYTIC DTDS
Greggio (2005) derived analytic DTDs for SD and DD
progenitor systems from assumptions about binary stellar evolution and mass exchange. Significant parameters for the shape of the DTD are the distribution and
range of stellar masses in progenitor systems, the efficiency of accretion in the SD scenario, and the distribution of separations at birth in the DD scenario. The
left-hand panel of Figure 14 shows several of the Greggio (2005) analytic DTDs: one for SD progenitors, and
two different prescriptions for DD progenitors (“WIDE”
and “CLOSE”). The difference between the DD prescriptions relates to the ratio between the separation of
the DD system and the initial separation of the binary,
A/A0. In the “WIDE” scheme, it is assumed that A/A0
spans a wide distribution, and that the distributions of
A and total mass of the system mDD are independent, so
one cannot necessarily predict the total merge time of a
system based on its initial parameters. In the “CLOSE”
scheme, there is assumed to be a narrow distribution of
A/A0 and a correlation between A and mDD, so the
most massive binaries tend to merge quickly and the
least massive merge last.
Here we state our assumptions for the hyperparameters which can affect the shape of the Greggio
(2005) DTDs. For the SD case, we assume a power law
slope of the mass ratio distribution with γ = 1, an efficiency of mass transfer ϵ = 1, and maximum initial
primary mass of 8 M⊙. For the DD channel, we additionally assume a nuclear timescale for the least massive
secondary τn,x = 1 Gyr, a minimum gravitational insprial delay τgw,i = 1 Myr, an exponent of the power law
distribution of final separations βa = 0 (for the WIDE
scheme), and an exponent of the power law distribution of gravitational delays βg = −0.75 (for the CLOSE
scheme).
In the left-hand panel of Figure 14, we also include
simple functions which approximate the analytic DTDs
of Greggio (2005). Chemical abundance distributions
are sensitive to the broad shape of the DTD but are
agnostic to the underlying physics of the progenitor systems. These simplified forms reduce the number of free
parameters for the DTD and make the GCE model predictions easier to interpret.
The right-hand panel of Figure 14 shows the results
of one-zone chemical evolution models with the Greggio (2005) DTDs and our simplified forms. We use the
same model parameters as in Section 3 but with different
values of η to spread the tracks out visually in [Fe/H].
The model with the SD DTD follows a nearly identical track to the exponential (τ = 1.5 Gyr) DTD, and
they produce very similar distributions of [O/Fe]. Likewise, the DD CLOSE DTD is well approximated by the
plateau DTD with W = 0.3 Gyr and a power-law slope
α = −1.1. The WIDE prescription is also best approximated by a plateau DTD, but with a longer plateau
width of W = 1 Gyr. In all cases, the effect of the
difference between the analytic DTD and its simple approximation is too small to be observed. We also ran a
multi-zone model with the inside-out SFH and the Greggio (2005) SD DTD and found it produced nearly identical results to the model with the exponential (τ = 1.5
Gyr) DTD.
C. STELLAR MIGRATION
In their multi-zone models, J21 randomly assign an
analogue star particle from h277, adopting its radial
migration distance ∆R and final midplane distance z,
for each stellar population generated by VICE. The ana-

logues are chosen such that the star particle was born
at a similar radius and time as the stellar population in
the GCE model. This prescription allows VICE to adopt
a realistic pattern of radial migration without needing
to implement its own hydrodynamical simulation. However, in regions where the number of h277 star particles
is relatively low, such as at large Rgal and small t, a
single h277 star particle can be assigned as an analogue
to multiple VICE stellar populations. These populations
will have similar formation and migration histories and
consequently similar abundances, which produces unphysical “clumps” of stars in the abundance distributions at large |z| and Rgal.
We adopt a prescription for radial migration which
produces smoother abundance distributions while still
following the behavior of h277. We fit a Gaussian to the
distribution of ∆R = Rfinal − Rform from the h277 output, binned by both formation radius Rform and age. We
are motivated by the findings of Okalidis et al. (2022)
that the strength of stellar migration in the Auriga simulations (Grand et al. 2017) varies with both Rform and
age. Each Gaussian is centered at 0, and we find that
the scale σRM is best described by the function
σRM = σRM8 τ
8 Gyr
0.33Rform
8 kpc
0.61
(C1)
where τ is the stellar age and σRM8 = 2.68 kpc describes the migration strength for an 8 Gyr old population with Rform = 8 kpc. For comparison, Frankel et al.
(2018) found a steeper τ -dependence of σRM ∝ τ
1/2
and a higher scaling of σRM8 = 3.6 kpc for a sample
of APOGEE red clump stars. Our age scaling is in
good agreement with Lu et al. (2023), who find that radial migration in galaxies from the NIHAO simulations
(Wang et al. 2015) follow a relatively universal relation
of σRM ∝ τ
0.32, but with a slightly higher σRM8 ≈ 3
kpc. We use the lower value here as it reproduces the
trends in h277, and by extension J21, but the ∼ 25%
difference may affect the predictions.
When VICE forms a stellar population at initial radius
Rform, we assign a value of ∆R by randomly sampling
from a Gaussian with a width given by Equation C1.
The star particle migrates to its final radius Rfinal in
a similar manner to the “diffusion” case from J21, but
with a time dependence ∝ ∆t
1/3
, motivated by the agescaling of σRM.
We note that the h277 galaxy has a weak and transient
bar, in contrast to the Milky Way. The presence of a
strong bar has been found to affect the strength of radial
migration throughout the disk (e.g., Brunetti et al. 2011)
and lead to a flattening of the metallicity gradient for
old populations (Okalidis et al. 2022).

row) and Gaussian sampling scheme (bottom row; see discussion in Appendix C). From left to right, star particles are binned
by formation annulus, as noted at the top of each column of panels. Within each panel, colored curves represent the different
age bins, ranging from the youngest stars (dark blue) to the oldest (dark red). In the top row, we exclude age bins with fewer
than 100 unique analogue IDs for visual clarity. All distributions are normalized so that the area under the curve is 1, and have
been boxcar-smoothed with a window width of 0.5 kpc. The vertical dotted black lines indicate the bounds of each bin in Rform;
stars within that region of the distribution have not migrated significantly far from their birth radius. §

30 Dubay, Johnson, & Johnson
Figure 15 compares the distributions of Rfinal in bins
of Rform and stellar age between the h277 analogue
method and our new prescription. There is good agreement across the Galaxy in the youngest age bins, but
the “clumpiness” of the h277 analogue populations, a
consequence of sampling noise, becomes evident for old
stars formed in the outer Galaxy. The distribution
of h277 star particles in the 10 ≤ τ < 12 Gyr and
11 ≤ Rform < 13 kpc bin indicates significant inward migration due to a merging satellite. Our Gaussian sampling scheme eliminates both the clumpiness and the
impact of mergers and other external events on radial
migration.
Like J21, we assume all stellar populations form in the
midplane (z = 0). J21 take the present-day midplane
distance zfinal directly from the h277 analogue particle.
To produce smoother abundance distributions, we fit a
sech2
function (Spitzer 1942) to the distribution of z in
h277. The PDF of zfinal given some scale height hz is
PDF(zfinal) = 1

. (C2)
We fit Equation C2 to the distributions of z in h277 in
varying bins of T and Rfinal. We find that hz is best
described by the function
hz = (hz,s/e2
) exp(τ /τs + Rfinal/Rs) (C3)
where hz,s = 0.24 kpc is the scale height at τs = 7 Gyr
and Rs = 6 kpc. For each star particle in VICE, we
sample zfinal from the distribution described by Equation C2 with a width given by Equation C3. Figure 16
shows the resulting distributions of zfinal are similar to
the h277 analogue scheme for all but the oldest stellar
populations.
D. QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON SCORES
Table 7 presents the quantitative scores which measure the difference between the multi-zone outputs and
APOGEE data for four observables. Details of the calculations for each observable are presented in the corresponding subsections of Section 4, but in summary,
divergence statistics between the multi-zone output and
APOGEE data (Equation 18 for the [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]
DFs, Equation 20 for the [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane, and
Equation 21 for the age–[O/Fe] plane) are computed
within each Galactic region. The overall score for the
model is the average of the divergence statistics across
all regions, weighted by the number of APOGEE targets
in each region. The scores can be strongly affected by
zero-point offsets between the model and observed abundance distributions, so we caution against using these
scores as an absolute metric of model performance.
